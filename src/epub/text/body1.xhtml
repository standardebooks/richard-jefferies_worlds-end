<p>
It is not generally known that the mighty city of Stirmingham owes its
existence to a water-rat. Stirmingham has a population of half a million, and
is the workshop of the earth. It is a proud city, and its press-men have traced
its origin back into the dim vista of the past, far before Alfred the
Great’s time, somewhere in the days of those monarchs who came from Troy,
and whose deeds Holinshed so minutely chronicles.
</p>

<p>
But this is all trash and nonsense, and is a cunning device of the able editors
aforesaid, who confound—for their own purposes—the city proper with
the tiny hamlet of Wolf’s Glow. This little village or cluster of houses,
which now forms a part, and the dirtiest part, of the city, can indeed be
traced through Hundred Rolls, Domesday Book, and Saxon Charters, almost down to
the time of the Romans. But Stirmingham, the prosperous and proud Stirmingham,
which thinks that the world could not exist without its watches and guns, its
plated goods, its monster factories and mills, which sends cargoes to
Timbuctoo, and supplies Java and Malabar with idols—this vast place,
whose nickname is a by-word for cheating, for fair outward show and no real
solidity, owes its existence to a water-rat. This is a fact. And it happened in
this way.
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time there was a wide expanse of utterly useless land, flat as this
sheet of paper, without a trace of subsoil or any kind of earth in which so
much as a blade of grass could grow. It was utterly dry and sterile—not a
tree nor a shrub to shelter a cow or a horse, and all men avoided it as a waste
and desolate place. It was the very abomination of desolation, and no one would
have been surprised to have seen satyrs and other strange creatures diverting
themselves thereon. Around one edge of this plain there flowed a brook, so
small that one could hardly call it by that name. A dainty lady from Belgravia
could have easily stepped across it without soiling the sole of her boot.
</p>

<p>
At one spot beside this brook there grew a willow tree. This tree was a picture
in itself, and would have made the fortune of any artist who would have
condescended to make a loving study of it. The trunk had been of very large
size, but now resembled a canoe standing upon end, for nearly one half had
decayed, and the crumbling wood had disappeared, leaving a hollow stem. The
stem was itself dead and decaying, except one thin streak of green, up which
the golden sap of life still ran, and invigorated the ancient head of the tree
to send forth yellow buds and pointed leaves. Up one side of the hollow trunk
an ivy creeper had climbed to the top, and was fast hanging festoons from bough
to bough.
</p>

<p>
In the vast mass of decaying wood at the top or head of the tree a briar had
taken root—its seed no doubt dropped by some thrush—and its prickly
shoots hung over and drooped to the ground in luxuriance of growth. The hardy
fern had also found a lodging here, and its dull green leaves, which they say
grow most by moonlight, formed a species of crown to the dying tree.
</p>

<p>
This willow was the paradise of such birds as live upon insects, for they
abounded in the decaying wood; and at the top a wild pigeon had built its nest.
As years went by, the willow bent more and more over the brook. The water
washing the soil out from between its roots formed a hollow space, where a
slight eddy scooped out a deeper hole, in which the vermillion—throated
stickleback or minnow disported and watched the mouth of its nest. This eddy
also weakened the tree by undermining it at its foundation. The ivy grew
thicker till it formed a perfect bush upon the top, and this in the winter
afforded a hold for the wind to shake the tree by. The wind would have passed
harmlessly through the slender branches, but the ivy, even in winter, the
season of storms, left something against which it could rage with effect.
Finally came the water-rat.
</p>

<p>
If Stirmingham objects to owe its origin to a water-rat, it may at least
congratulate itself upon the fact that it was a good old English rat—none
of your modern parvenu, grey Hanoverian rascals. It was, in fact, before the
Norwegian rat, which had been imported in the holds of vessels, had obtained
undisputed sway over the country. It had, however, already driven the darker
aboriginal inhabitants away from the cultivated places to take refuge in the
woods and streams. It is odd that in the animal kingdom also, even in the rat
economy, the darker hued race should give way to the lighter. However, as in
Stirmingham the smoke is so great that the ladies when they walk abroad carry
parasols up to keep the blacks from falling on and disfiguring their
complexion, there can after all be no disgrace in the water-rat ancestry.
</p>

<p>
This dark coloured water-rat, finding his position less and less secure at the
adjacent barn on account of the attacks of the grey invaders, one fine day
migrated, with Mrs Rat and all the Master and Missy rats, down to the stream.
Peeping and sniffing about for a pleasant retreat, he chose the neighbourhood
of the willow tree. I cannot stay here to discuss whether or no he was led to
the tree by some mystic beckoning hand—some supernatural presentiment;
but to the tree he went, and Stirmingham was founded. Two or three
burrows—small round holes—sufficed to house Mr Rat and his family,
but these ran right under the willow, and of course still further weakened it.
</p>

<p>
In course of time the family flourished exceedingly, and Mr Rat became a
great-great-great-grandpapa to ever so many minor Frisky Tails. These Frisky
Tails finding the ancient quarter too much straightened for comfort, began to
scratch further tunnels, and succeeded pretty well in opening additional
honeycombs, till presently progress was stayed by a root of the tree. Now they
had gnawed through and scratched away half a dozen other roots, and never
paused to sniff more particularly at this than the others. But it so happened
that this root was the one which supplied the green streak up the trunk of the
tree with the golden sap of life drawn by mysterious chemical processes from
the earth. Frisky Tails gnawed this root asunder, and cut off the supply of
sap. The green streak up the trunk withered and died, and the last stay of the
willow was gone. It only remained for the first savage south-wester of winter
to finish the mischief.
</p>

<p>
The south-wester came, and over went the trunk, crash across the brook. At
first this was very awkward for the rats, as thereby most of their subterranean
dwellings became torn up and exposed. But very soon a geological change
occurred.
</p>

<p>
The tree had fallen obliquely across the stream, and its ponderous head, or
top, choked up the bed, or very nearly. The sand and small sticks, leaves, and
so on, brought down by the current, filled up the crevices left by the tree,
and a perfect dam was formed.
</p>

<p>
Now, as stated before, the ground thereabout was nearly level, and so worthless
in character that no man ever troubled his head about it. No one came to see
the dam or remove it. The result was the brook overflowed, and then finding
this level plateau, instead of eating out a new channel, it spread abroad, and
formed first a good-sized puddle, then a pond, then something like a flood,
and, as time went by, a marsh. This marsh extended over a space of ground fully
a mile long, and altogether covered some nine hundred acres.
</p>

<p>
The rats, sagacious creatures, instead of deserting their colony, showed that
they possessed that species of wisdom which the Greek sage said was superior to
all other knowledge—namely, the knowledge how to turn an evil to a good.
Exploring this shallow lake which their carelessness had caused, they found
several places still unsubmerged—islands, in fact. To one of these they
swam, dug out new catacombs, and being now quite safe from interruption, and
protected upon all sides, the Malthusian laws of population had full play, and
soon proved its force, for the whole place swarmed with them. The axiom,
however, that at the very point when empires are apparently most prosperous,
their destruction is near at hand, to some extent applied even to the dominion
of the water-rat. They were no longer to be the sole undisturbed possessors.
</p>

<p>
Arguing <i>à priori</i>, one would have concluded that if this waste
land was worthless before, now it was a marsh, and miasmatic vapours arose from
it, it would be still more avoided. But the facts were exactly opposite. So
soon as ever the water had spread over the level plain, and had well soaked
into the sterile soil, there began to spring up tough aquatic grasses, commonly
called bull-polls, from a supposed resemblance between their tangled appearance
and the rough hair that hangs over the poll of a bull.
</p>

<p>
These grasses are gregarious—that is to say, they prefer to grow in huge
bunches. Each bunch increasing year after year, forms in time a small hillock
or tuft, and, the roots spreading and spreading, these hillocks of grass almost
covered the lake, leaving only narrow channels of water between. Upon these
innumerable frogs and toads crawled up out of the water, and they were the
chosen resorts of newts.
</p>

<p>
In summer time the blue dragon-fly wheeled in mazes over them, or, while
settled on the stiff blades of grass, looked like a species of blossom. The
current of the brook brought down seeds, and soon the tall reed began to rear
its slender stem, and rustle its feathery head in the breeze. The sedges came
also, and fringed the marsh with a border of green.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, the root which the rats had gnawed asunder beneath the ancient willow
tree, felt the power of spring, and made one more effort. Freed from the
incubus of the dead trunk, it threw out a shoot of its own. From this shoot
there proceeded other shoots; and, in short, after a while the islands in the
marsh became covered with willow trees and osier-beds. The reeds grew apace,
and by the time the islands were clothed with willow, the rest of the marsh was
occupied by them, saving only the fringe of sedge, and the almost immortal
bull-polls, which were as tough as leather, and which nothing could kill.
</p>

<p>
Now, also, animal life began to people the once-deserted waste. With the sedges
came the sedge-warblers; with the willows came the brook-sparrows; and above
all, came the wild-fowl. The heron stalked to and fro between the bull-polls;
the ducks swam in and out; the moor-hens took up their residence; and in winter
the widgeons and snipes visited the place in myriads.
</p>

<p>
It was now time for man. And man came. He came first in the person of here and
there a cotter, who cut himself a huge bundle of reeds for fuel, to mend his
thatch, or litter his pig; then in the person of the poacher—if it could
be called poaching to hunt where no one preserved—who, with
long-barrelled gun, brass-fitted and flint-locked, brought down half a dozen
ducks at once, and then waded in after them.
</p>

<p>
One day a travelling gipsy tribe came by, and encamped for the night close to
the marsh. In this tribe there was a man who, in his way, possessed the genius
of Alexander the Great. Alexander chancing to pass a landlocked harbour utterly
neglected, saw at a glance its capabilities, and built a city which is renowned
to this day.
</p>

<p>
This gipsy fellow, who was only a gipsy by marriage, saw this unoccupied marsh,
with its wild-fowl, its fish, and, above all, its willows, and at once fixed
upon it as a promising spot.
</p>

<p>
He was a basket-maker by trade.
</p>

<p>
He waded in to one of the islets, carrying his infant in his arms, and followed
by his wife, who carried his tools. He set up his tent-pole, and in time
superseded it with a cottage of sod, roofed with reeds. All day he made baskets
of willow and flags, in the evening he shot ducks and widgeon. The baskets he
sold in the towns, the ducks he ate. One or two others followed his example.
</p>

<p>
The gipsy tribe made it a rule to come that way twice a year to purchase the
baskets and retail them all over the country. The original settlers had sons,
and the sons took possession of other islets, built sod cottages, of
wattle-and-daub, and married wives, till there were ten or twelve settlements
upon the islands; and these ten or twelve, all in a rude sort of way, gave the
chieftainship to the original basket-maker, whose name happened to be Baskette.
</p>

<p>
These people, in the heart of a midland county, lived almost exactly the life
that was led at the same period by the dwellers in the fen countries to the
eastward. It was a rude existence, but it was free and independent, and not
without a charm to those who had been born and bred in it. Even this unenviable
life was, however, to be disturbed. Two mighty giants were preparing, like the
ogres in the fairy tales, to eat up the defenceless population. The lid of a
certain tea-kettle had puffed up and down, and Steam had been born. The other
ogre was called Legal Rights, and began to bite first.
</p>





<h3>Two.</h3>

<p>
So long as this waste land was tenanted only by the “owl and the
bittern,” Legal Rights slumbered. The moment man put his foot upon it the
ogre woke up, for it is not permitted to that miserable two-legged creature to
rest in peace anywhere in this realm.
</p>

<p>
The village of Wolf’s Glow was distant about a mile and a quarter from
the old willow tree whose fall had dammed up the brook and caused the marsh.
The brook, in fact, ran past the village, and supplied more than one farmhouse
with water. These farms were of the poorest class—mere stretches of
pasture-land, and such pasture which a well-fed donkey would despise!
</p>

<p>
The poorest farm, in appearance at all events, was Wick—a large but
tumbledown place, roofed with grey slates, which, stood apart from the village.
It was the largest house in the place, and yet seemed the most
poverty-stricken. The grey slates were falling off. The roof-tree had cracked
and bent, the lattice windows were broken, and the holes stuffed up with
bundles of hay and straw. The garden was choked with weeds, and the very apple
trees in the orchard were withering away.
</p>

<p>
Old Sibbold, the owner and occupier, was detested by the entire village, and by
no one more than his two sons. He was a miser, and yet nothing seemed to
prosper with him; and pare and save as much as he would he could make no
accumulation. His sons were the only labourers he employed, though his farm was
the largest thereabouts, and he paid them only in lodging and food, and not
much of the latter.
</p>

<p>
The eldest, Arthur, chafed bitterly under this treatment, for he appears, from
the scanty records that remain of him, to have been a lad of spirit and energy.
</p>

<p>
The second son, James, was of a grosser nature, and his mind was chiefly
occupied with eating and drinking. He had an implicit faith in the wealth of
his father, and submitted patiently to all these hardships and rough treatment
in the hope of ingratiating himself with the old man, and perhaps supplanting
Arthur in his will—that is, so far as his money was concerned, for the
land, as the villagers said, “went by heirship”—i.e. was
entailed—but who would care for such land?
</p>

<p>
Arthur saw the game and did nothing to prevent it; on the contrary, he took a
certain pleasure in irritating the savage and morose old man, whom he
thoroughly despised. Perhaps what happened in the future was a punishment for
this unfilial conduct, however much it was provoked.
</p>

<p>
The mother, it must be understood, had long been dead, and there was no
mediator between the stern old man and his fiery-tempered son. Old Sibbold was
descended of a good family—one that had once held a position, not only in
the county but in the country—and he dwelt much on the past, recalling
the time when a Sibbold had held a bishop a prisoner for King John.
</p>

<p>
He pored over the deeds in his old oak chest—a press, which stood on four
carved legs, and was closed with a ponderous padlock. That chest, if it could
be found now, would be worth its weight, not in gold merely, but in diamonds.
At that time these deeds and parchments were of little value; they related
mostly to by-gone days, and Arthur ridiculed his father’s patient study
of their crabbed handwriting.
</p>

<p>
What was the use of dwelling on the past?—up and speculate on the
present!
</p>

<p>
Irritated beyond measure, old Sibbold would reply that half the county belonged
to him, and he could prove it. All that they could see from that window was
his.
</p>

<p>
“Why,” said Arthur, “all we can see is the Lea, which is as
barren as the crown of my hat, except in weeds and bulrushes!”
</p>

<p>
“Barren or not, they’re mine,” said Sibbold, closing his
chest; “and I will make those squatters pay!”
</p>

<p>
For the Lea was that piece of waste ground which the brook had overflowed, and
in a sense rendered fertile.
</p>

<p>
From that hour began a persecution of the basket-makers who had settled on the
little islets in the marsh. Sibbold had an undoubted parchment
right—whether he had a moral and true right to a place he had never
touched with spade or plough is a different matter. He claimed a rent. The
cotters refused to pay. Their chieftain, old Will Baskette, wanted to
compromise matters, and offered a small quit-rent.
</p>

<p>
Now every one knows that quit-rent and rent are very different things in a
legal point of view. A man who pays rent can be served with notice to quit. A
man who pays quit-rent has a claim upon the soil, and cannot be ejected.
Sibbold refused the quit-rent, and had the squatters served with a notice. They
went on cutting reeds, weaving baskets, and shooting wild-fowl, just the same;
till one day old Sibbold, accompanied with a posse of constables (there were no
police in those days), walked into the marsh with his jack-boots on; and, while
one of the cotters was absent selling his baskets, began to tear the little hut
down, despite the curses of the women and the wailing of the children. But the
hut, as it happened, was stronger in reality than appearance, and resisted the
attack, till one of the constables suggested fire.
</p>

<p>
A burning brand from the cottage hearth was applied by old Sibbold himself to
the reed thatch, and in a moment up shot a fierce blaze which left nothing but
ashes, and sod walls two feet high. One can imagine the temper a man of gipsy
blood would be in when, on returning home, he found his children crying and the
women silent, sitting among the ruins. From that hour a spirit of revenge took
possession of the dwellers in this Dismal Swamp of hostility to the village.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto these half savage people had paid of their own free will a kind of
tribute to the regular house-folk of Wolf’s Glow. The farmers’
wives received useful presents of baskets and clothes-pegs, and every now and
then half a dozen wild ducks were found on the threshold in the morning. The
clergyman was treated in a similar manner; and being known to have a penchant
for snipes and woodcocks, his table was well supplied in the season. Sometimes
there were other things left in a mysterious way at the door—such as a
bladder full of the finest brandy or Hollands gin, or a packet of tobacco or
snuff.
</p>

<p>
This was generally after the visit of the gipsy tribe, who were smugglers to a
considerable extent. No farmer ever missed a lamb or a horse: such property was
far safer since the settlement of the Dismal Swamp.
</p>

<p>
But now the village had attacked the Swamp, the Swamp retaliated on the
village, and a regular war commenced. The farmers’ sheep began to
disappear—none so often as old Sibbold’s. Once a valuable horse of
his was lost. This drove him to the verge of frenzy. He went down to the Swamp,
and presently returned swearing and vowing vengeance—he had been shot at.
This aroused the clergyman into action. He went to the Swamp, and was received
with respect. He talked of conciliation, and reproved them, especially speaking
of the sin of murder. They listened, but utterly scouted the idea.
</p>

<p>
“We steal,” they said, openly. “It is our revenge; but we do
not murder. Sibbold was not fired at. One of our young men was seeking
ducks—he did not know that Sibbold at the same moment was creeping
noiselessly through the reeds to fire our huts. He shot at the ducks, and some
of the pellets glanced off Sibbold’s jack-boots. That’s the
truth.”
</p>

<p>
And it was the truth. But Sibbold vowed vengeance, and was heard to say that he
would have their blood. He refused to see the clergyman who came to mediate and
explain. He accused him of complicity, and reviled him.
</p>

<p>
James, as usual, agreed with and seconded him. Arthur sided with the squatters,
and said so openly. Sibbold cursed him. Arthur said pointedly that when he
inherited the land the squatters should be unmolested. Sibbold struck him with
an ash stick.
</p>

<p>
Arthur left the house and went to the Swamp. He called on old Will Baskette,
and expressed his hatred of his father’s tyranny. He asked to be taught
to make baskets, and to be initiated into the gipsy mysteries. He was a quick
lad, and they took an interest in teaching him. He soon knew how to make two or
three kinds of baskets, learnt the gipsy language, and imbibed their singular
traditions.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the war continued. At first the farmers and villagers put up with
patience with their thefts, considering that it was Sibbold’s fault. But
repeated losses exasperated them. If one of the Dismal Swamp people was seen
abroad he was set upon and maltreated, beaten black and blue. Savage dogs were
hounded at them. Sibbold was encouraged to eject them. He tried to get a posse
of constables to do so, but the constables hung back. They had heard the story
of the shooting at Sibbold; they knew these men to be desperate characters; and
most of them had had presents of brandy and tobacco, and ribbons for their
wives.
</p>

<p>
They could not be got to move. That was a lawless age in outlying places.
Finding this, the village began to contemplate a raid <i>en masse</i> upon the
Swamp. Nothing was talked of in the alehouse but fighting. Men compared the
length of their gun-barrels, and put up marks to prove the range of their shot.
The younger men were ready for the fray, the elders hesitated. They looked at
their thatched houses, at their barns and ricks. The insurance companies had
not then penetrated into the most obscure nooks and corners.
</p>

<p>
After all, the Swamp people were not unsupported: they were a branch of a
tribe. If they were seriously injured the tribe might return, and no one could
calculate the consequences.
</p>

<p>
So the foray was put off from day to day. But the news that it was meditated
soon reached the Swamp, and made the dwellers there more desperate than ever.
Their thefts grew to such a height that nothing was safe. The geese and turkeys
disappeared; wheat was stolen from the barns; sheep were taken by the dozen,
and no trace could be found. Now and then a horse disappeared. It came to such
a pitch that the very beer in the barrels, the cider in the cellar, was not
safe, but was taken nightly.
</p>

<p>
Old Sibbold, of course, suffered most. Tapping a cider barrel, he found it
quite empty. The old man was beside himself with rage; but he said nothing. He
studied retaliation. He watched his barns—the wheat seemed to disappear
under his very eyes. One night as he was returning from his barn, carrying his
long-barrelled flint-lock under his arm, he fancied he saw a gleam of light in
the ivy, which almost hid the cellar window. Stealthily he peeped through.
There was a man stooping down, drawing off the cider from a barrel into a
bucket.
</p>

<p>
Old Sibbold’s lips compressed; a fire came into his eyes. He grasped his
gun. Just then the thief held up the candle in his left hand, and revealed the
features of old Will Baskette, the very chief of the Swamp. Sibbold hated him
more particularly because he knew that Arthur frequented his hut. Up went the
long gun. The gleam of light from the candle guided the aim. The muzzle was
close to the lattice window. A cruel eye glanced along the barrel, a finger was
on the trigger. The flint struck the steel with a sharp snick—a spark
flew out—an explosion—the window-glass smashed—a cloud of
smoke—one groan, and all was still.
</p>

<p>
Sibbold rushed round the house, opened the door gently, locked it behind him,
and stole upstairs. On the landing he met his youngest son James. For a moment
they looked at one another. The young man spoke first.
</p>

<p>
“Quick, and load your gun,” he said. “Then put it in the rack
and get into bed. Give me your breeches.”
</p>

<p>
They wore breeches and gaiters in those days.
</p>

<p>
The old man did as he was bid. The gun was put in the rack; old Sibbold got
into bed. James took his breeches, poured a bucket of water on them, and hung
them up in the wide chimney—the embers still glowed on the hearth. Then
he stole upstairs.
</p>

<p>
“Arthur is out,” he whispered, as he passed the old man’s
bedroom.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes passed. Then there arose clatter of feet and a shouting.
</p>

<p>
“Farmer! farmer! your house is a-fire. The thatch be caught
alight.”
</p>

<p>
James opened the window, yawned, and asked what was the matter.
</p>

<p>
“Father’s asleep,” he said, as if not comprehending them.
“He got wet in the brook, and went to bed early. Can’t ye come in
the morning?”
</p>

<p>
But the others soon roused the house.
</p>

<p>
The thatch had indeed caught over the cellar window; but fortunately it was
nearly covered with moss and weeds, and was easily put out.
</p>

<p>
Then some one noticed the smashed window. “Who was it fired?” they
asked. “We heard a shot, and thought it was the swampers. We were
watching our sheep and barns. Then we saw this fire in your thatch, and ran.
Who was it fired? How came the window smashed like this? How came the thatch
alight?” James answered, “He really did not know. He had heard no
shot, he slept sound, knew nothing of the thatch being on fire, and they would
have been burnt in their beds if it had not been for their kind
neighbours.” Old Sibbold stood and shivered in his shirt, his breeches
were wet. The neighbours came in.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll go upstairs and fetch father a blanket to wrap his knees
in,” said James. “Father, thee blow the embers up; John Andrews,
thee knows where the cellar is: give ’em the key, father, and do you go,
John, and draw some cider.”
</p>

<p>
Away went John Andrews with the lantern, and came back with a face white as a
sheet, just as James got downstairs. There was a dead man in the cellar, in a
flood of gore and cider!
</p>

<p>
The result was a coroner’s inquiry; the thefts and so forth might have
gone on for ever, but death could not be disregarded. Even in that lawless age,
death was attended to. An inquest was held, and the jury was composed of the
farmers of the village. Suspicion fell very strongly upon old Sibbold. The
Swamp people openly denounced him as the murderer. His neighbours, much as they
hated the Swamp, believed in their hearts that they were right; and not all
their class prejudice could overcome the innate horror they felt in his
presence. More than one had heard him say he would have blood. Now there was
blood enough.
</p>

<p>
Still there was not enough evidence to arrest Sibbold. The Swamp people said he
would run away, and if he did they would watch him and bring him back. But
Sibbold did nothing of the kind. He faced the inquiry with a stern dignity
which imposed on some.
</p>

<p>
First came the medical evidence. The doctor proved that the shot had entered
the left side, just below the heart, and had passed downwards. It had entered
all together—the pellets not spread about, but close together, like a
bullet, which proved that the gun had been fired very close. Death must have
been absolutely instantaneous. Deceased was in a stooping posture when he
received the charge.
</p>

<p>
The constable who had examined the premises, declared it as his
belief—as, indeed, it was the belief of everyone present—that the
shot had been fired from without the window. The shot itself could not have
smashed every pane—that was the concussion. The thatch had been doubtless
set on fire by a piece of the paper which had been used as wadding.
</p>

<p>
When this had been said there was nothing more to be done, at least so the jury
thought. Suspect Sibbold as much as they would, they were determined to protect
him if possible. This was partly class-feeling, and partly remembrance of the
provocation.
</p>

<p>
But the Coroner was not to be put off so easily. He had Sibbold called, and
questioned him closely. He called James also, but they both stuck to their
tale; they had never heard the shot, etc. The Coroner sent for Sibbold’s
gun, keeping Sibbold and James at the inn where the inquest was held meantime.
It was brought. It told no tales: it was loaded. Finally, the Coroner, still
dissatisfied and vaguely suspicious, called <i>Arthur</i> Sibbold, who, white
as a sheet, was sitting near on a bench watching the proceedings.
</p>

<p>
He started at his name and looked round, but finally came forward. Where had he
been that night? He was at Bassett, a small town six miles distant. What was
his business there? what time did he leave? and so on. Arthur answered, but not
so clearly as was desired. He contradicted himself as to the time at which he
left Bassett, and got confused.
</p>

<p>
The Coroner’s suspicions shifted upon him. He must have arrived about the
time the shot was heard, yet he did not go indoors, did not show himself till
breakfast-time next morning. James vouched for that, unasked. What was he doing
all night?
</p>

<p>
Suspicion fell very strong on Arthur. But at this moment the wife of the
deceased started forward and declared her belief in his innocence, recounting
how he had learnt basket-making, etc, of the dead man, and they had been on the
most friendly terms.
</p>

<p>
Still, said the Coroner, he might have mistaken his man in the uncertain light.
Had he a gun? It was shown that the three Sibbolds had but one gun; that Arthur
never used a gun, being of a tender nature, and often expressing his dislike to
see birds wantonly slaughtered.
</p>

<p>
The Sibbolds were then, with the other witnesses, ordered out, and the Coroner
addressed the jury.
</p>

<p>
He told them plainly where his suspicions lay: one of the Sibbolds, he was
certain, did the deed, but which? Two were in bed, or at least were to all
appearance in bed, and one point in their favour was that the thatch was
alight. Now, if they had known that, they would hardly have lain till the
neighbours came up. The third was out that night, and, according to his own
showing, must have returned about the time the murder was committed. But in his
favour it was urged that he was on the best of terms with the deceased; that he
had no gun of his own; that he disliked the use of a gun. He said much more,
but these were the chief points, and particularly he laid down the law. They
must not imagine because a man was stealing that thereby his life was at any
one’s mercy. If a struggle took place, and the thief was killed in the
struggle, there were then several loopholes of escape from the penalty of the
law. First, it might be called chance-medley; next, there would be a doubt
whether the stab or shot was not given in self-defence, and was not intended to
kill. But in this case there was every appearance of deliberate murder. The
thief had been spied at the cask; the murderer had coolly aimed along his gun
and fired, hitting his man in a vital part, evidently of design and
aforethought.
</p>

<p>
He then left the jury to their deliberations. They talked it over half an hour
in a sullen manner, and then <i>returned an open verdict</i>—“Found
dead.” The Coroner remonstrated, and recommended that at least it should
be “Wilful murder against persons unknown,” but they were
obstinate.
</p>

<p>
That verdict stands to this day. The dread spectre of the gallows vanished from
Wolf’s Glow. Old Will Baskette was buried in the churchyard, and his
funeral was attended by the whole of the Swamp people and half the village. And
over their ale the farmers whispered that it served the old thief right, but
they avoided old Sibbold. The work of the rats had already brought fruit in
bloodshed.
</p>







<h3>Three.</h3>

<p>
In these days such a verdict and such an ending to a tragedy would be out of
the question; but there were no police in those times to take up a case if it
chanced to slip by the Coroner. Once past the Coroner, and the criminal was
practically safe. The county officers were never in a hurry for such
prosecutions, for a gallows cost at least 300 pounds. They wanted a public
prosecutor then ten times more than we do now. Sibbold was shunned by the very
men who had acquitted him; but there is no reason to suppose he ever felt
remorse. He was made of that kind of stuff of which the men in armour, his
ancestors, were composed, who thought little or nothing of human life. But one
day he met Arthur, his eldest son, face to face upon the stairs. It was the
first time they had met since the inquest—Arthur had avoided the place,
and wandered about a good deal by himself, till some simple folk began to think
that it was he who had committed the deed, and that his conscience was
troubling him.
</p>

<p>
This meeting on the stairs took place by accident one morning—Sibbold was
going to pass, but Arthur put his hand on his shoulder, “I saw you do
it,” he said. He had just entered the rick yard when the shot was fired.
He had held his peace, but his mind could not rest. “I cannot stay
here,” he said, “I am going. I shall never see you again.”
</p>

<p>
Old Sibbold stood like a stone; but presently put his hand in his pocket and
held out his purse.
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Arthur; “not a penny of that, it would be blood
money.”
</p>

<p>
He went, and evil report went after him. Perhaps it was James who fanned the
flame, but for years afterwards it was always believed that Arthur had shot the
basket-maker. Only the Swamp people combated the notion. Arthur was one of
them, and understood their language—it was impossible. Not to have to
return to these times, it will be, perhaps, best to at once finish with old
Sibbold; though the event did not really happen till some time after
Arthur’s departure.
</p>

<p>
Sibbold went to a fair at some twenty miles distance—a yearly custom of
his; and returning home in the evening, he was met by highwaymen, it is
supposed, and refusing to give up his money bag, was shot. At all events his
horse came home riderless, and the body of the old man was found on the heath
divested of every article of value. Suspicion at once fell on his known
enemies, the Swamp people. Their cottages were searched and nothing found.
Their men were interrogated, but had all been either at home or in another
direction. Calm reason put down Sibbold’s death to misadventure with
highwaymen, common enough in those times; but there were those who always held
that it was done in revenge, as it was believed that the gipsies retained the
old vendetta creed.
</p>

<p>
As Arthur did not return, James took possession, and went on as usual; but he
did not disturb the Swamp settlement. He avoided them, and they avoided him.
</p>

<p>
When Will Baskette was shot he left a widow and two sons, one of them was
strong and hardy, the other, about sixteen, was delicate and unfit for rough
outdoor life. This fact was well-known to the clergyman at Wolf’s Glow,
the Rev. Ralph Boteler, who was really a benevolently-minded man.
</p>

<p>
The widow and her eldest son joined the gipsy tribe and abandoned the Swamp.
The Rev. Ralph Boteler took the delicate Romy Baskette into his service as man
of all work, meaning to help in the garden and clean the parson’s nag.
Romy could not read, and the parson taught him—also to write. Being quiet
and good-looking, the lad won on the vicar, who after a time found himself
taking a deep interest in the friendless orphan. It ended in Romy leaving the
garden and the stable, and being domiciled in the studio, where the parson
filled his head with learning, not forgetting Latin and Greek.
</p>

<p>
The vicar was a single man, middle-aged, with very little thought beyond his
own personal comfort, except that he liked to see the hounds throw off, being
too stout to follow them. He had, however, one hobby; and, like other men who
are moderate enough upon other topics, he was violence itself upon this. Of all
the hobbies in the world, this parson’s fancy was geology—then just
beginning to emerge as a real science.
</p>

<p>
The neighbours thought the vicar was as mad as a March hare on this one point.
He grubbed up the earth in forty places with a small mattock he had made on
purpose at the village blacksmith’s. He broke every stone in the district
with a hammer which the same artisan made for him.
</p>

<p>
His craze was that the neighbourhood of Wolf’s Glow was rich in the two
great stores of nature which make countries powerful—i.e. in Coal and
Iron. He proved it in twenty ways. First, the very taste of the water, and the
colour of the earth in the streams; by the nodules of dark, heavy stone which
abounded; by the oily substance often found floating on the surface of
ponds—rock oil; by the strata and the character of the fossils; by actual
analysis of materials picked up by himself; lastly, by archaeology.
</p>

<p>
Wolf’s Glow! What was the meaning of that singular name? The only Glow in
the county. Wolf was, perhaps, a man’s name in the centuries since. But
Glow? Glow was, without a doubt, the ancient British for <i>coal</i>.
</p>

<p>
The people who argued against him—and they were all he
met—ridiculed the idea of the ancient Britons knowing anything of coal.
Boteler produced his authorities to show that they, and their conquerors the
Romans, were perfectly familiar with that mineral. Wolf’s Glow was, in
fact, Wolf’s Coal Pit. “Very well,” said the Objectors,
“show us the coal pit, and we’ll believe.” This the vicar
could not do, and was held to be mad accordingly.
</p>

<p>
But all this talking, and searching, and analysing made a deep impression upon
the mind of young Romy Baskette, who was now hard upon twenty years of age.
Boteler, really desirous of pushing the lad on, sent him to London, whither
Arthur Sibbold had preceded him, and placed him, at a high premium, in the care
of a friend of his, who was in the iron trade. Romy grew and prospered, and
being of a serious disposition saved all the money he could lay hands on.
Presently old Boteler died, and left him, not all, but a great share of his
worldly wealth. With this he bought a share in the iron business, and became a
partner. Wealth rolled in upon him, and at an early period of life he retired
from active labour, married, and bought an estate a few miles from Wolf’s
Glow.
</p>

<p>
In his leisure hours the memory of the old days with the vicar returned. He
resolved to test the vicar’s theory. He purchased a small piece of land
in Wolf’s Glow parish, sank a shaft, and sure enough came upon
<i>coal</i>.
</p>

<p>
This discovery revivified the whole man. He cast off sloth, forgot all about
retirement, and plunged into business again. Another search, conducted by
practical hands, proved the existence of iron.
</p>

<p>
There was a <i>furore</i>. Collieries were started; iron furnaces set going. It
was just at the dawn of the great iron and coal trade. The railways had been
started, and the demand was greater than the supply. Romy Baskette and Company
soon employed two thousand hands coal-digging and iron-smelting. The man, in
fact, wore himself out at the trade of money-making. He could not rest. Night
and day his brain was at work: An accidental conversation with one of his
workmen suggested to him a new idea. The smiths of the time could not make
nails fast enough for all the building that was going on. This workman had been
a sailor in his day, and had seen nails abroad which were made in batches by
machinery, instead of slowly and laboriously, one by one, by hand.
</p>

<p>
Baskette caught at the idea. He studied and learnt what he could. He made a
voyage himself abroad, and soon mastered the secret. He erected machinery, and
<i>cut</i> nails were first made. The consumption was enormous. The business of
this Baskette and Company became so large that it almost passed out of control.
Meantime other firms had come and settled, bought land, dug up coal, and set up
smelting furnaces. In ten years the population from being absolutely nil rose
to thirty-five thousand people. By this time Romy had killed himself. But that
mattered little, for he had left a son, and a son who inherited all his genius,
and was—if anything still “harder in the mouth.” He was
named, from his mother’s family, Sternhold Baskette.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold picked up the plough-handle which had dropped from his father’s
grasp, and continued the good work, never once looking back. But although
equally clever, the bent of his genius was different from that of old Romy.
Romy was at heart a speculator, and believed in personal property. Sternhold
was a Conservative, and put his faith in real property, houses, and land. He
kept up the old forges and collieries, but he started no new ones. He invested
the money in land and houses, particularly the latter. His life may be summed
up in two strokes of genius—the first was bringing the iron horse to
Stirmingham, as the new town was called; the second was the building lease
investment.
</p>

<p>
It is hard to give the pre-eminence to either. They were both profound
schemes—neither would have been complete without the other. He did not
originate the idea of the railway—that was done for him—but he put
it on its legs, and he brought it to the centre of the town.
</p>

<p>
The original scheme almost omitted Stirmingham. Railways were not then fully
understood; their projectors had such vast ideas in their heads, they aimed at
long trunk lines, and so this railroad was to connect London, the sea, and a
certain large town—larger than Stirmingham then, but now nothing beside
the modern city.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold, as the largest shareholder, and as finding the capital to get
through Parliament, prevailed to have the course altered so as to sweep by
Stirmingham. He knew that this would improve his property there at least fifty
per cent. But he had other ideas in his head. The line could not be finished
under three years, and in those three years it was his intention to become
possessed of the whole ground upon which the town of Stirmingham stood. He
foresaw that it would become a mighty centre. He braced up his nerves, and
prepared to spend his darling hoards like water.
</p>

<p>
One by one the fields, the plots, the houses, became his; and the greed growing
on him, he cast longing eyes on the adjacent marsh, now called Glow’s
Lea.
</p>

<p>
The solicitors he employed tried to restrain his infatuation. They represented
to him that even his vast wealth could not sustain this more than kingly
expenditure, and as to the marsh, it was sheer madness to purchase it. In vain.
Perhaps a tinge of pride had something to do with it. He would buy up the
rotten old Swamp where his progenitor had dwelt, drain it, and cover it with
mansions.
</p>

<p>
But now came a difficulty—the title to the ground was not all that could
be wished. James had been dead some years, but it was well-known that had
Arthur returned—if Arthur still lived, or his heirs—that James had
no right. He had enjoyed the farm and the land, such as it was, unmolested, all
his life. He had married, and had eight sons. Six of these had married since,
and most of them had children.
</p>

<p>
As none could claim the property, they all found a miserable livelihood upon
it, somehow or other. They had degenerated into a condition little better than
that of the squatters in the Swamp.
</p>

<p>
Three families lived in the farmhouse, constantly quarrelling; two made their
dwelling in the cowsheds, slightly improved; one boiled the pot in the great
carthouse, and the two single men slept in the barn. Such a condition of
slovenliness and dirt it would be hard to equal. And the language, the
fighting, and the immorality are better left undescribed! The clergyman of
Wolfs Glow wished them further.
</p>

<p>
To these wretches the offers of Sternhold Baskette came like the promised land.
He held out 300 pounds apiece, on condition that they would jointly sign the
deed and then go to America. They jumped at it. The solicitor warned Baskette
that the contract was not sound. He asked, in reply, if any one could produce
the deed under which the property descended by “heirship.” No one
could. Somehow or other it had been lost.
</p>

<p>
In less than a month eight Sibbolds, with their wives and families, were <i>en
route</i> to the United States, and Sternhold took possession. Then came the
Swamp settlement difficulty.
</p>

<p>
At first Baskette thought of carrying matters with a high hand. The squatters
said they had lived there for two generations, or nearly so, and had paid no
rent. They had a right. Sternhold remembered that they were of his clan. He
gave them the same terms as the Sibbolds—and they took them. Three
hundred pounds to such miserable wretches seemed an El Dorado.
</p>

<p>
They signed a deed, and went to America, filling up half a vessel, for there
were seventeen heads of families, and children <i>ad libitum</i>.
</p>

<p>
Thus Sternhold bought the farm and the Swamp for 7500 pounds. His aim in
getting them to America was that no question of right might crop up—for
the Cunard line was not then what it is now, and the passage was expensive and
protracted. He reckoned that they would spend the money soon after landing, and
never have a chance of returning.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the railway came to a standstill. There had been inflation—vast
sums of promotion money had been squandered in the usual reckless manner, and
ruin stared the shareholders in the face. To Sternhold it meant absolute loss
of all, and above everything, of prestige.
</p>

<p>
Already the keen business men of the place began to sneer at him. At any cost
the railway must be kept on its legs. He sacrificed a large share of his
wealth, and the works recommenced. The old swamp, or marsh, was drained.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold had determined to make this the Belgravia of Stirmingham, and had the
plans prepared accordingly. They were something gigantic in costliness and
magnificence. His best friends warned and begged him to desist. No; he would go
on. Stirmingham would become the finest city in England, and he should be the
richest man in Europe. Up rose palatial mansions, broad streets, splendid
club-houses—even the foundations of a theatre were laid. And all this was
begun at once. Otherwise, Sternhold was afraid that the compass of an ordinary
life would not enable him to see these vast designs finished. So that one might
walk through streets with whole blocks of houses only one story high.
</p>

<p>
Everything went on swimmingly, till suddenly the mania for speculation which
had taken possession of all the kingdom received a sudden check by the failure
of a certain famous railway king.
</p>

<p>
As if by magic, all the mighty works at Stirmingham ceased, and Sternhold grew
sombre, and wandered about with dejected step. His friends, men of business,
reminded him of their former warnings. He bent his head, bit his lip, and said
only, “Wait!”
</p>

<p>
Meantime the line had been constructed, but was not opened. The metals were
down, but the stations were not built, and the locomotives had not arrived.
Everybody was going smash. Several collieries failed; land and houses became
cheap. Sternhold invested his uttermost in the same property—bought
houses, till he had barely enough to keep him in bread and cheese. Still they
laughed and jeered at him, and still he said only, “Wait!”
</p>

<p>
This place, this swamp, seemed to be fated to demonstrate over and over again
at one time the futility of human calculation, and at another what enormous
things can be accomplished by the efforts of a clever man.
</p>







<h3>Four.</h3>

<p>
The owner of three parts of Stirmingham—now a monstrous overgrown city,
just building a cathedral—actually had nothing but a little bread and
cheese for supper. There were people who condoled with him, and offered to lend
him sums of money—not large, but very useful to a starving man, one would
have thought. He shrugged his shoulders and said, “Thank you; I’ll
wait.”
</p>

<p>
Certain keen speculators tried to come round him in twenty different ways. They
represented that all this mass of bricks and mortar—this unfinished
Belgravia—really was not worth owning; no one could ever find the coin to
finish the plans, and house property had depreciated ninety per cent.
</p>

<p>
“Very true,” said Sternhold. “Good morning, gentlemen.”
</p>

<p>
He held on like grim death. Men of genius always do—mark Caesar, and all
of them. ’Tis the bulldog that wins.
</p>

<p>
By-and-by things began to take a turn. The markets looked up. Iron and coal got
brisker. The first locomotive was put on the line, then another, and another;
London could be reached in two hours, goods could be transmitted in six,
instead of thirty by the old canal or turnpike.
</p>

<p>
The Stock Exchange got busy again. You could hear the masons and
bricklayers—chink, tink, tinkle, as their trowels chipped off the
edges—singing away in chorus. The whistle of the engines was never
silent. Vast clouds of smoke hung over the country from the factories and
furnaces. Two or three new trades were introduced—among others, the
placed goods, cheap jewellery, and idol-making businesses, and trade-guns for
Africa. Rents began to rise; in two years they went up forty per cent. The
place got a name throughout the length and breadth of the kingdom, and a Name
is everything to a town as well as to an individual.
</p>

<p>
But by a curious contradiction, just as his property began to rise in value,
and his investment looked promising, Sternhold grew melancholy and walked about
more wretched than ever. The truth soon leaked out—he had no money to
complete his half-finished streets and blocks of houses. Nothing could induce
him to borrow; not a halfpenny would he take from any man.
</p>

<p>
There the streets and houses, the theatres, club-houses, magnificent mansions,
huge hotels, languished, half-finished, some a story, some two stories high,
exposed to wind and weather. In the midst of a great city there was all this
desolation, as if an enemy had wreaked his vengeance on this quarter only.
</p>

<p>
Large as were the sums derived from his other properties—houses and shops
and land, which were occupied—it was all eaten up in the attempt to
finish this <i>marble</i> Rome in the middle of a brick Babylon. Heavy amounts
too had to be disbursed to keep the railway going, for it did not pay a
fraction of dividend yet. Men of business pressed on Sternhold. “Let us
complete the place,” they said. “Sell it to us on building leases;
no one man can do the whole. Then we will form three or four companies or
syndicates, lease it of you, complete the buildings, and after seventy years
the whole will revert to you or your heirs.”
</p>

<p>
Still Sternhold hesitated. At last he did lease a street or two in this way to
a company, who went to work like mad, paid the masons and bricklayers double
wages, kept them at it day and night, and speedily were paying twenty per cent,
dividends on their shares out of the rents of the completed buildings. This
caused a rush. Company after company was formed. They gave Sternhold heavy
premiums for the privilege to buy of him; even then it was difficult to get him
to grant the leases. When he did accept the terms and the ready cash, every
halfpenny of it went to complete streets on his own account; and so he lived,
as it were, from hand to mouth.
</p>

<p>
After all this excitement and rush, after some thousands of workmen were put at
it, they did not seem to make much impression upon the huge desolation of brick
and mortar. Streets and squares rose up, and still there were acres upon acres
of wilderness, foundations half-dug out and full of dirty water, walls three
feet high, cellars extending heaven only knew where.
</p>

<p>
People came for miles to see it, and called it “Baskette’s
Folly.” After a while, however, they carefully avoided it, and called it
something worse—i.e. “The Rookery;” for all the scum and
ruffianism of an exceptionally scummy and ruffianly residuum chose it as their
stronghold. Thieves and worse—ill-conditioned women—crowds of lads,
gipsies, pedlars—the catalogue would be as long as
Homer’s—took up their residence in these foundations and cellars.
They seized on the planks which were lying about in enormous piles, and roofed
over the low walls; and where planks would not do they got canvas.
</p>

<p>
Now, it is well-known that this class of people do not do much harm when they
are scattered about and separated here, there, and everywhere over a city; but
as soon as they are concentrated in one spot, then it becomes serious. Gangs
are formed, they increase in boldness; the police are defied, and not a house
is safe.
</p>

<p>
This place became a crying evil. The papers raved about it, the police (there
were police now) complained and reported it to head-quarters. There was a
universal clamour. By this time Stirmingham had got a corporation, aldermen,
and mayor, who met in a gorgeous Guildhall, and were all sharp men of business.
Now the corporation began to move in this matter of “Baskette’s
Folly.” Outside people gave them the credit of being good citizens,
animated by patriotic motives, anxious for the honour of their town, and
desirous of repressing crime. Keen thinkers knew better—the Corporation
was not above a good stroke of business. However, what they did was this: After
a great deal of talk and palaver, and passing resolutions, and consulting
attorneys, and goodness knows what, one morning a deputation waited upon
Sternhold Baskette, Esq, at his hotel (he always lived at an hotel), and laid
before him a handsome proposition. It was to the effect that he should lease
them the said “Folly,” or incomplete embryo city, for a term of
years, in consideration whereof they would pay down a certain sum, and contract
to erect buildings according to plans and specifications agreed upon, the whole
to revert in seventy years to Sternhold or his heirs.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold fought hard—he asked for extravagant terms, and had to be
brought to reason by a threat of an appeal by the Corporation to Parliament for
a private Act.
</p>

<p>
This sobered him, for he was never quite happy in his secret mind about his
title. Terms were agreed upon, the earnest money paid, and the masons began to
work. Then suddenly there was an uproar. The companies or syndicates who had
leased portions of the estate grew alarmed lest this enormous undertaking
should, when finished, depreciate their property. They cast about for means of
opposing it. It is said—but I cannot believe it—that they gave
secret pay to the thieves and ruffians in the cellars to fight the masons and
bricklayers, and drive them off.
</p>

<p>
At all events serious collisions occurred. But the Corporation was too strong.
They telegraphed to London and got reinforcements, and carried the
entrenchments by storm.
</p>

<p>
Then, so goes the discreditable rumour, the companies bribed the masons and
bricklayers, who built so badly that every now and then houses fell in, and
there was a fine loss! Finally they got up an agitation, cried down the
Corporation for wasting public funds, and, what was far more serious, brought
high legal authority to prove that <i>as a Corporation</i> they had no power to
pledge themselves to such terms as they had, or indeed to enter into such a
contract without polling the whole city.
</p>

<p>
This alarmed the Corporation. There were secret meetings and long faces. But if
one lawyer discovers a difficulty, another can always suggest a way round the
corner. The Corporation went to Parliament, and got a private Act; but they did
not go as a body. They went through Sternhold, who was persuaded; and indeed it
looked plausible, that by so doing, and by getting the sanction of the House of
Commons, he improved his own title.
</p>

<p>
Then the Corporation smiled, and built away faster than ever. In the course of
an almost incredibly short time the vast plans of Sternhold were completed by
the various companies, by the Corporation, and by himself; for every penny he
got as premium, every penny of ground-rent, every penny from his collieries,
iron furnaces, and cut-nail factories, went in bricks and mortar. It was the
most magnificent scheme, perhaps, ever started by a single man. The city was
proud of it. Like Augustus, he had found it brick, and left it marble.
</p>

<p>
Yet, in reality, he was no richer. The largest owner, probably, of house
property in the world, he could but just pay his way at his hotel. Although he
had a fine country house (which old Romy had purchased) in the suburbs, he
never used it—it was let. He preferred a hotel as a single man because
there was no trouble to look after servants, etc. He lived in the most
economical manner—being obliged to, in fact.
</p>

<p>
Yet this very economy increased the popular belief in his riches. He was a
miser. Give a man that name, let it once stick to him, and there is no limit to
the fables that will be eagerly received as truth. Give a dog a bad name and
hang him. Call a man a miser, and, if he is so inclined, he can roll in
borrowed money, dine every day on presents of game and fish, and marry any one
he chooses. I only wish I had the reputation.
</p>

<p>
No one listened to Sternhold’s constant reiteration of what was
true—that he was really poor. It was looked upon as the usual
stock-in-trade language of a miser. His fame spread. Popular rumour magnified
and magnified the tale till it became like a chapter from the Arabian Nights.
</p>

<p>
After all, there was some grain of truth in it. If he could have grasped all
that was his, he would have surpassed all that was said about his riches.
</p>

<p>
At last the <i>Stirmingham Daily News</i> hit upon a good idea to out-distance
its great rival the <i>Stirmingham Daily Post</i>. This idea was a “Life
of Sternhold Baskette, the Miser of Stirmingham.” After, the editor had
considered a little, he struck out “miser,” and wrote
“capitalist”—it had a bigger sound.
</p>

<p>
The manuscript was carefully got up in secret by the able editor and two of his
staff, who watched Sternhold like detectives, and noted all his peculiarities
of physiognomy and manner. They knew—these able editors know
everything—that the public are particularly curious how much salt and
pepper their heroes use, what colour necktie they wear, and so on. As the
editor said, they wanted to make Sternhold the one grand central
figure—perfect, complete in every detail. And they did it.
</p>

<p>
They traced his origin and pedigree—this last was not quite accurate, but
near enough. They devoted 150 pages to a mere catalogue of his houses, his
streets, his squares, club-houses, theatres, hotels, railways, collieries,
ironworks, nail factories, estates, country mansions, etc. They wrote 200 pages
of speculations as to the actual value of this enormous property; and modestly
put the total figure at “something under twenty millions, and will be
worth half as much again in ten years.” They did not forget the building
leases; when these fell in, said the memoir, he or his heirs would have an
income of 750,000 pounds per annum.
</p>

<p>
They carefully chronicled the fact that the capitalist had never married, that
he had no son or daughter, that he was growing old, or, at least, past middle
age, and had never been known to recognise any one as his relation (having, in
fact, shipped the whole family to America). What a glorious thing this would be
for some lucky fellow! They finished up with a photograph of Sternhold himself.
This was difficult to obtain. He was a morose, retiring man—he had never,
so far as was known, had his portrait taken. It was quite certain that no
persuasion would induce him to sit for it. The able editor, however, was not to
be done. On some pretext or other Sternhold was got to the office of the paper,
and while he sat conversing with the editor, the photographer “took
him” through a hole made for the purpose in the wooden partition between
the editor’s and sub-editor’s room. As Sternhold was quite
unconscious, the portrait was really a very good one. Suddenly the world was
taken by storm with a “Life of Sternhold Baskette, the Capitalist of
Stirmingham. His enormous riches, pedigree, etc, 500 pages, post octavo,
illustrated, price 7 shillings 6 pence.”
</p>

<p>
The able editor did not confine himself to Stirmingham. Before the book was
announced he made his London arrangements, also with the lessees of the railway
bookstalls. At one and the same moment of time, one morning Stirmingham woke up
to find itself placarded with huge yellow bills (the <i>News</i> was Liberal
then—it turned its coat later on—and boasted that John Bright had
been to the office), boys ran about distributing handbills at every door, men
stood at the street corners handing them to everybody who passed.
</p>

<p>
Flaring posters were stuck up at every railway station in the kingdom; ditto in
London. The dead walls and hoardings were covered with yellow paper printed in
letters a foot long. Three hundred agents, boys, girls, and men, walked all
over the metropolis crying incessantly “Twenty Millions of Money,”
and handing bills and cards to every one. The <i>Athenaeum, Saturday Review,
Spectator</i>, and <i>Times</i>; every paper, magazine, review; every large
paper in the country had an advertisement. The result was something
extraordinary.
</p>

<p>
The name of Sternhold Baskette was on everybody’s lips. His “Twenty
Millions of Money” echoed from mouth to mouth, from Land’s End to
John o’ Groats. It crossed the Channel, it crossed the Alps, it crossed
the Atlantic and the Pacific. It was heard on the Peak of Teneriffe, and in the
cities of India.
</p>

<p>
The New York firms seized on it as a mine of wealth. The book, reprinted, was
sold from the Hudson River to the Rocky Mountains, and to the mouth of the
Mississippi for twenty cents. The circulation was even larger in the United
States than in Britain, for there everybody worshipped the dollar. The able
editor made his fortune. The book ran through thirty editions, and wore out two
printing machines and three sets of type. The two gentlemen of the staff who
had assisted in the compilation had a fair share, and speedily put on airs.
They claimed the authorship, though the idea had certainly originated with the
editor. There was a quarrel. They left, being offered higher salaries in this
way:—The other paper, the <i>Post</i>, though blue in principles, grew
green with envy, and tried to disparage as much as possible. They offered these
respectable gentlemen large incomes to cut the book to pieces that they
themselves had written. No one could do it better—no one understood the
weak points, and the humbug of the thing so well. The fellows went to work with
a will. The upshot was a little warfare between the Sternholders and the
anti-Sternholders. The <i>News</i> upheld Sternhold, stuck to everything it had
stated, and added more. The <i>Post</i> disparaged him in every possible way.
This newspaper war had its results, as we shall presently see. For the present
these two noble principled young men, who first wrote a book for pay and then
engaged to chop it into mincemeat for pay, may be left to search and search
into the Baskette by-gone history for fresh foul matter to pour forth on the
hero of Stirmingham.
</p>







<h3>Five.</h3>

<p>
“The Hero of Stirmingham;” so the <i>News</i> dubbed him; so it
became the fashion, either in ridicule or in earnest, to call him. People came
from all parts to see him. Every one who, on business or pleasure, came to the
city, tried to lodge at the hotel where he lived, or at least called there on
the chance of meeting the mortal representative of Twenty Millions Sterling.
The hotel proprietor, who had previously lost money by him, and execrated his
economy, now reaped a golden harvest, and found his business so large that he
set about building a monster place at one side of the original premises, for he
was afraid to pull it down lest the capitalist should leave.
</p>

<p>
Now a curious psychological change was wrought by all this in old
Sternhold’s character. Up till this period of his life he had been one of
the most retiring and reserved of men, morose, self-absorbed, shrinking from
observation. He now became devoured with an insatiable vanity. He could not
shake off the habit of economy, the frugal manner of living, which, he had so
long practised; but his mind underwent a complete revolution.
</p>

<p>
It has often been observed that when a man makes one particular subject his
study, in course of time that which was once clear grows obscure, and instead
of acquiring extraordinary insight, he loses all method, and wanders.
</p>

<p>
Something of the kind was the case with Sternhold. All his life had been
devoted to the one great object of owning a city, of being the largest
proprietor of houses and streets in the world. His whole thought, energy,
strength, patience—his entire being—had been concentrated upon this
end. In actual fact, it was not attained yet, for he was practically only the
nominal owner; but the publication of this book acted in a singular manner upon
his brain. He grew to believe that he really was all that the
“Life” represented him to be—i.e. the most extraordinary man
the world had ever seen.
</p>

<p>
He attempted no state, he set up no carriage; he stuck to his old confined
apartments at the hotel he had always frequented; but he lived in an ideal life
of sovereign grandeur. He talked as though he were a monarch—an absolute
autocrat—as if all the inhabitants of Stirmingham were his subjects; and
boasted that he could turn two hundred thousand people out of doors by a single
word.
</p>

<p>
In plain language, he lost his head; in still plainer language, he went
harmlessly mad—not so mad that any one even hinted at such a thing. There
was no lunacy in his appearance or daily life; but the great chords of the mind
were undoubtedly at this period of his existence quite deranged.
</p>

<p>
He really was getting rich now. The houses he had himself completed, with the
premiums paid for building leases, began to return a considerable profit. The
income from his collieries and factories was so large, that even bricks and
mortar could not altogether absorb it. Perhaps he was in receipt of three
thousand pounds per annum, or more. But now, unfortunately, just as the fruits
of his labour were fast ripening, this abominable book upset it all.
</p>

<p>
There can be no doubt that the editor of the <i>Stirmingham Daily News</i>,
with the best intentions in the world, dealt his Hero two mortal wounds. In the
first place, he drove him mad. Sternhold spent days and nights studying how he
could exceed what he had already done.
</p>

<p>
Dressed in a workman’s garb for disguise, he explored the whole
neighbourhood of Stirmingham, seeking fresh land to purchase. His object was to
get it cheap, for he knew that if there was the slightest suspicion that he was
after it, a high price would be asked. In some instances he succeeded. One or
two cases are known where he bought, with singular judgment and remarkable
shrewdness, large tracts for very small sums. He paid only one-fifth on
completion, leaving the remainder on mortgage. This enabled him to buy five
times as much at once as would have otherwise been possible.
</p>

<p>
But there were sharp fellows in Stirmingham, who watched the capitalist like
hawks, and soon spied out what was going on. Their game was to first discover
in what direction Sternhold was buying in secret, then to forestall him, and
nearly double the price when he arrived.
</p>

<p>
In this way Sternhold got rid of every shilling of his income. Even then he
might have prospered; but, as bad luck would have it, the railway, after two
millions of money had been sunk on it, actually began to pay dividends of three
and a half per cent, then four, then six; for a clever fellow had got at the
helm, and was forcing up the market so as to make hay while the sun shone.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold was in raptures with railways. Some sharp young men of forty-five and
fifty immediately laid their heads together, and projected a second railway at
almost right angles—not such a bad idea, but one likely to cause enormous
outlay. They represented to Sternhold that this new line would treble the value
of the property he had recently bought, extending for some miles beyond the
city. He jumped at it. The Bill was got through Parliament. One half of these
sharp young men were lawyers, the other half engineers and contractors.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold deposited the money, and they shared it between them. When the money
was exhausted the railway languished. This exasperated old Baskette. For the
first time in his life he borrowed money, and did it on a royal scale;—I
am almost afraid to say how much, and certainly it seems odd how people could
advance so much knowing his circumstances.
</p>

<p>
However, he got it. He bought up all the shares, and became practically owner
of the new line. He completed it, and rode on the first locomotive in triumph,
surrounded by his parasites. For alas! he had yielded to parasites at last, who
flattered and fooled him to perfection. This was the state of affairs when the
second mortal wound was given.
</p>

<p>
It happened in this way. The “Life of Sternhold Baskette, Esq,”
had, as was stated, got abroad, and penetrated even to the Rocky Mountains. It
was quoted, and long extracts made from it in the cheap press—they had a
cheap press in the United States thirty years before we had, which accounts for
the larger proportion of educated or partly educated people, and the wider
spread of intelligence. After a while, somehow or other, the marvellous story
reached the ears of one or two persons who happened to sign their names
Baskette, and they began to say to themselves, “What the deuce is this?
We rather guess we come from Stirmingham or somewhere thereabouts. Now, why
shouldn’t we share in this mine of wealth?”
</p>

<p>
The sharp Yankee intellect began to have “idees.” Most of the
cotters whom Sternhold had transhipped to America thirty years or more
previous, were dead and buried—that is to say, the old people were.
</p>

<p>
The air of America is too thin and fine, and the life too fast, for middle-aged
men who have been accustomed to the foggy atmosphere and the slow passage of
events in the Old Country. But it is a tremendous place for increase of
population.
</p>

<p>
The United States are only just a century old, and they have a population
larger than Great Britain, which has a history of twenty centuries, or nearly
so.
</p>

<p>
So it happened that, although the old people were dead, the tribe had
marvellously increased. Half who were transhipped had borne the name of
Baskette. This same question was asked in forty or fifty places at
once—“My name is Baskette; why should not I share?”
</p>

<p>
These people had, of course, little or no recollection of the deed signed by
their forefathers: and if they had had a perfect knowledge, such a trifling
difficulty as that was not one calculated to appal a Yankee’s ingenuity.
When once the question had been asked it was repeated, and grew and grew, and
passed from man to man, made its appearance in the newspapers, who even went so
far as to say that the finest city in England, the very workshop of the
Britishers, belonged to United States citizens.
</p>

<p>
Some editor keener than the rest, or who had read the book more carefully,
pointed out that the capitalist had no heirs living, that he had never been
married, and no one knew to whom all this vast wealth would descend.
</p>

<p>
Twenty millions sterling begging a heir! This was enough to set the American
mind aflame. It was just like applying a lighted match to one of their
petroleum wells.
</p>

<p>
The paragraph flew from paper to paper, was quoted, conned, and talked over.
Men grew excited. Presently, here and there one who considered that he had some
claim began to steal off to England to make inquiries. The Cunard were running
now, though they had not yet invented the “ocean highway,” by
keeping to a course nothing to the north or south of a certain line. Passage
was very quick, and not dear. In a little time the fact that one or two had
started oozed out, then others followed, and were joined by a lawyer or so,
till at last fourteen or fifteen keen fellows reached Stirmingham.
</p>

<p>
Now mark the acuteness of the American mind! Instead of announcing their
arrival, every one of these fellows kept quiet, and said not a word! When they
met each other in the streets they only smiled. They were not going to alarm
the game.
</p>

<p>
These gentlemen were not long in Stirmingham before they found out that the
<i>Stirmingham Daily Post</i> was a deadly enemy of old Sternhold. To the
office of the second able editor they tramped accordingly.
</p>

<p>
There they learnt a good deal; but in return the editor pumped something out of
them, and, being well up in the matter, sniffed out their objects. He chuckled
and rubbed his hands together. Here was a chance for an awful smash at the
<i>News</i>.
</p>

<p>
One fine morning out came a leading article referring also to several columns
of other matter on the same subject, headed “The Heirs of
Stirmingham.”
</p>

<p>
Being Blue, you see, the <i>Post</i> affected to abominate United States’
Republicanism and all the American institutions. This article recounted the
visit of the dozen or so of possible claimants, described them so minutely that
no one could help recognising them, and wound up with a tremendous peroration
calling upon all good citizens to do their best to prevent the renowned city of
Stirmingham falling into the hands of the Yankees!
</p>

<p>
Such property as Sternhold’s, the article argued, was of national
importance; and although the individual should not be interfered with, the
nation should see that its rights were not tampered with. There was danger of
such tampering, for who knew what an <i>infirm, old</i> man like Sternhold
might not be led to sign by interested parties? At his age he could not be
expected to possess the decision and mental firmness of earlier years. This was
a cruel hit at Sternhold’s mental weakness, which had begun to grow
apparent.
</p>

<p>
An endeavour should be made to find an English heir, and that there was such an
heir they (the staff of the <i>Post</i>) firmly believed. Two gentlemen of the
staff (meaning thereby the late writers for the <i>News</i>), who had devoted
some time to the matter, had made a certain important discovery. This was
nothing less than the fact that Sternhold had had an uncle! This in big capital
letters.
</p>



<p>
An Uncle. Then followed a little bit of genealogy, in approved fashion, with
dashes, lines, etc—the meaning of which was that Sternhold’s
father, old Romy Baskette, had had a brother, who, when the original Will
Baskette was shot, had departed into the unknown with his mother.
</p>

<p>
What had become of Romy’s brother? The probability was that by this time
he was dead and buried. But there was also the probability that he had married
and had children. Those children, if they existed, were undoubtedly the nearest
heirs of Sternhold Baskette, Esq, now residing at Dodd’s Hotel, South
Street. As an earnest of the anxiety of the <i>Post</i> to preserve the good
city of Stirmingham from Yankee contamination, they now offered three
rewards:—First, fifty pounds for proof of Romy’s brother’s
death; secondly, one hundred pounds for proof of Romy’s brother’s
marriage, if he had married; thirdly, one hundred and fifty pounds for the
identification of his child or children. This was repeated as an advertisement
in the outer sheet, and was kept in type for months.
</p>

<p>
It deserves notice as being the first advertisement which appeared in the Great
Baskette Claim Case—the first of a crop of advertisements which in time
became a regular source of income to newspaper proprietors.
</p>

<p>
When this leading article and advertisement, supported by several columns of
descriptive matter and genealogies was laid on the breakfast tables of half
Stirmingham, it caused a sensation. The city suddenly woke up to the fact that
as soon as old Sternhold died half the place would have no owner.
</p>

<p>
The Yankee visitors now had no further reason for concealment. They went about
openly making inquiries. They were fêted at hotel bars and in billiard
rooms. They called upon Sternhold bodily—<i>en masse</i>—forced
themselves into his apartment, though, he shut the door with his own hands in
their faces, shook him by the hand, patted him on the shoulder, called him
“Colonel,” and asked him what he would take to drink!
</p>

<p>
They walked round him, admired him from every point of view, stuck their
fingers in his ribs, and really meant no harm, though their manners were not
quite of the drawing-room order.
</p>

<p>
They cut up the old man’s favourite armchair, whittled it up, to carry
away as souvenirs. They appropriated his books—his own particular
penholder, with which he had written every letter and signed every deed for
fifty years, disappeared, and was afterwards advertised as on show at
Barnum’s in New York City, as the Pen which could sign a cheque for
Twenty Millions!
</p>

<p>
When at last they did leave, one popped back, and asked if the
“Colonel” believed this story about his <i>Uncle</i>? He was sure
he had never had an uncle, wasn’t he? The old man sat silent, which the
inquirer took for once as a negative, and wrote a letter to the <i>News</i>,
denying the existence of Romy’s brother.
</p>

<p>
Poor old Sternhold was found by the landlord, old Dodd, sitting in his chair,
which was all cut and slashed, two hours afterwards, staring straight at the
wall.
</p>

<p>
Dodd feared he had an attack of paralysis, and ran for the nearest doctor; but
it was nothing but literally speechless indignation. After a while he got up
and walked about the room, and took a little dry sherry—his favourite
wine. But the mortal wound Number 2 had been given. Henceforth the one great
question in Sternhold’s mind was his heir.
</p>







<h3>Six.</h3>

<p>
His heir! Sternhold seriously believed that he had no living relations. It is
often said that poor people have plenty of children, while the rich, to whom
they would be welcome, have few or none. This was certainly a case in point.
The poor Baskettes, who had been shipped to America, had a whole tribe of
descendants. Here was a man who, nominally at least, was the largest owner of
property known, who was childless, and had already reached and exceeded the
allotted age of man.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold was seventy-two. He looked back and ransacked his memory. He had
never heard anything of this uncle, his father’s brother; his
mother’s friends were all dead. There was not a soul for whom he cared a
snap of his fingers. Firstly, he had no relations; secondly, he had no friends,
for Sternhold, wide as was his circle of acquaintances, had never been known to
visit any one. His life had been solitary and self-absorbed.
</p>

<p>
Now, for the first time, he felt his loneliness, and understood that he was a
solitary being. Who should be his heir? Who should succeed to that mighty
edifice he had slowly built up? The architect had been obliged to be content
with gazing upon the outside of his work only; but the successor, if he only
lived the usual time, would revel in realised magnificence unsurpassed. The old
man was quite staggered, and went about as in a dream.
</p>

<p>
The idea once started, there were plenty who improved upon it. The Corporation
at their meetings incidentally alluded to the matter, and it was delicately
suggested that Sternhold would crown his memory with ineffable glory if he
devised his vast estate to the city. Such a bequest in a few years would make
the place absolutely free from taxation. The rents would meet
poor’s-rates, gas-rates, water-rates, sanitary-rates, and all. One
gentleman read an elaborate series of statistics, proving that the income from
the property, when once the building leases fell in, would not only free the
city from local, but almost, if not quite, from imperial taxation. There were
many instances in history of kings, as rewards for great services, issuing an
order that certain towns should be exempt from the payment of taxes for a
series of years. Sternhold had it thus in his power to display really regal
munificence.
</p>

<p>
Other gentlemen of more radical leanings cried “Shame!” on the mere
fact of one man being permitted to attain such powers. It was absurd for one
man to possess such gigantic wealth, and for several hundred thousand to live
from hand to mouth. The people should share it, not as a gift, but as a right;
it should be seized for the benefit of the community.
</p>

<p>
The Corporation people were much too knowing to talk like this. They went to
work in a clever way. First, they contrived various great banquets, to which
Sternhold was invited, and at which he was put in the seat of honour and lauded
to the skies. Next, they formed a committee and erected a statue in a prominent
place to the founder of Stirmingham, and unveiled it with immense ceremony.
Certain funds had been previously set apart for the building of a public
library; this being completed about that time, was named the Sternhold
Institute. An open space or “park,” which the Corporation had been
obliged to provide for the seething multitudes who were so closely crowded
together, was called the Sternhold Public Park. Yet Sternhold never subscribed
a farthing to either of these.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was left undone to turn his head. His portrait, life-size, painted in
oil, was hung up in the Council-hall; medals were struck to commemorate his
birthday. The Corporation were not alone in their endeavours; other
disinterested parties were hard at work. Most energetic of all were the
religious people. Chapel projectors, preachers, church extension societies,
missionary associations, flew at his throat. His letter-box was flooded; his
door was for ever resounding with knocking and ringing. The sound of the true
clerical nasal twang was never silent in his anteroom. The hospitals came down
on him flat in one lump, more particularly those establishments which publicly
boast that they never solicit assistance, and are supported by voluntary
contributions caused by prayer.
</p>

<p>
The dodge is to publish the <i>fact</i> as loudly as possible. To proclaim that
the institution urgently wants a few thousands is not begging. A list of all
the charities that recommended themselves to his notice would fill three
chapters: then the patentees—the literary people who were prepared to
write memoirs, biographies, etc—would have to be omitted.
</p>

<p>
Now here is a singular paradox. If a poor wretched mortal, barely clothed in
rags, his shoes off his feet, starring with hunger, houseless, homeless, who
hath not where to lay his head, asks you for a copper, it means seven
days’ imprisonment as a rogue. If all the clergymen and ministers, the
secretaries, and so forth, come in crowds begging for hundreds and thousands,
it is meritorious, and is applauded.
</p>

<p>
Now this is worthy of study as a phenomenon of society. But these were not all.
Sternhold had another class of applicants, whom we will not call ladies, or
even women, but <i>females</i> (what a hateful word female is), who approached
him pretty much as the Shah was approached by every post while in London and
Paris.
</p>

<p>
He was deluged with photographs of females. Not disreputable characters
either—not of Drury Lane or Haymarket distinction, but of that class who
use the columns of the newspapers to advertise their matrimonial propensities.
Tall, short, dark, light, stout, thin, they poured in upon him by hundreds; all
ready, willing, and waiting.
</p>

<p>
Most were “thoroughly domesticated and musical;” some were
penetrated with the serious responsibilities of the position of a wife; others
were filled with hopes of the life to come (having failed in this).
</p>

<p>
Some men would have enjoyed all this; some would have smiled; others would have
flung the lot into the waste-basket. Sternhold was too methodical and too much
imbued with business habits to take anything as a good joke. He read every
letter, looked at every photograph, numbered and docketed them, and carefully
put them away.
</p>

<p>
Other efforts were made to get at him. He had parasites—men who hung on
him—lickspittles. To a certain extent he yielded to the titillation of
incessant laudation; and, if he did not encourage, did not repel them. They
never ceased to fan his now predominant vanity. They argued that the
Corporation and all the rest were influenced by selfish motives (which was
true). They begged him not to forget what was due to himself—not to
annihilate and obliterate himself. It was true he was aged; but aged
men—especially men who had led temperate lives like
himself—frequently had children. In plain words, they one and all
persuaded him to marry; and they one and all had a petticoated friend who would
just suit him.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold seemed very impassive and immoveable; but the fact was that all this
had stirred him deeply. He began to seriously contemplate marriage. He brooded
over the idea. He was not a sentimental man; he had not even a spark of what is
called human nature in the sense of desiring to see merry children playing
around him. But he looked upon himself as a mighty monarch; and as a mighty
monarch he wished more and more every day to found not only a kingdom, but a
dynasty.
</p>

<p>
This appears to be a weakness from which even the greatest of men are not
exempt. Napoleon the Great could not resist the idea. It is the one sole object
of almost all such men whose history is recorded. Occasionally they succeed;
more often it destroys them. Some say Cromwell had hopes in that direction.
</p>

<p>
So far the parasites, the photographs, the stir that was made about it,
affected Sternhold. But if he was mad, he was mad in his own way. He was not to
be led by the nose; but those who knew him best could see that he was
meditating action.
</p>

<p>
Dodd, the landlord of the hotel, was constantly bothered and worried for his
opinion on the subject. At last, said Dodd, “I think the Corporation have
wasted their money.” And they had.
</p>

<p>
In this unromantic country the human form divine has not that opportunity to
display itself which was graciously afforded to the youth of both sexes in the
classic days of Greece, when the virgins of Sparta, their lovely limbs anointed
with oil, wrestled nude in the arena.
</p>

<p>
The nearest approach to those “good old times” which our modern
prudery admits, is the short skirts and the “tights” of the ballet.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold, deeply pondering, arrived at the notion, true or false, that the
wife for him must possess physical development.
</p>

<p>
This is a delicate subject to dwell on; but I think he was mistaken when he
visited the theatres seeking such a person. He might have found ladies, not
<i>females</i> nor women, but ladies in a rank of life nearer or above his own,
who exulted in the beauty of their form, and were endowed with Nature’s
richest gifts of shape. But he was a child in such a search: his ideas were
rude and primitive to the last degree. At all events, the fact remains.
</p>

<p>
It was found out afterwards that he had visited every theatre in London, but
finally was suited on the boards of a fourth-rate “gaff” in
Stirmingham itself.
</p>

<p>
There was a girl there—or rather a woman, for she was all
five-and-twenty—who was certainly as fine a specimen of <i>female</i>
humanity as ever walked. Tall, but not too tall, she presented a splendid
development of bust, torso, and limbs. Her skin was of that peculiar dusky
hue—not dark, but dusky—which gives the idea of intense vitality.
Her eyes were as coals of fire—large, black, deep-set, under heavy
eyebrows. Her hair at a distance was superb—like night in hue, and
glossy, curling in rich masses. Examined closer it was coarse, like wire. Her
nose was the worse feature; it wanted shape, definition. It was a decided
<i>retroussé</i>, and <i>thick</i>; but in the flush of her brilliant
colour, her really grand carriage, this was passed over. Her lips were scarlet,
and pouted with a tempting impudence.
</p>

<p>
This was the very woman Sternhold sought. She was vitality itself
impersonified. He saw her, offered his hand, and was instantly accepted. He
wished her to keep it quiet; and notwithstanding her feminine triumph she
managed to do so, and not a soul in Stirmingham guessed what was in the wind.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold went to London, got a special licence, and the pair were married in
Sternhold’s private apartments at his hotel in the presence of three
people only, one of whom was the astounded Dodd. They left by the next train
for London, where the bride went to Regent Street to choose her trousseau, with
her husband at her side.
</p>

<p>
Not a bell was rung in Stirmingham. The news spread like wildfire, and
confounded the city. People gathered at the corners of the streets.
</p>

<p>
“He is certainly mad,” they said. Most of them were in some way
disappointed.
</p>

<p>
“He may be,” said a keener one than the rest; “he may
be—but <i>she</i> is not.”
</p>







<h3>Seven.</h3>

<p>
Lucia Marese, now Mrs Sternhold Baskette, was the daughter of an Italian father
and an English mother, and had a tolerably accurate acquaintance with Leicester
Square and Soho. She was not an absolutely bad woman in the coarsest sense of
the term—at least not at that time, she had far too much ambition to
destroy her chance so early in life. Physiologists may here discuss the
question as to whether any latent trace of the old gipsy blood of the Baskettes
had in any way influenced Sternhold in his choice. Ambitious as she was, and
possessed of that species of beauty which always takes with the multitude,
Lucia had hitherto been a failure. Just as in literature and in art, the
greatest genius has to wait till opportunity offers, and often eats its own
heart in the misery of waiting, so she had striven and fought to get to the
front, and yet was still a stroller when Sternhold saw her. She knew that if
only once she could have made her appearance on the London boards, with her
gorgeous beauty fully displayed, and assisted by dress and music, that she
should certainly triumph. But she could not get there.
</p>

<p>
Other girls less favoured by Nature, but more by circumstance, and by the
fickle and unaccountable tastes of certain wealthy individuals, had forestalled
her, and she stored up in her mind bitter hatred of several of these who had
snubbed and sneered at her.
</p>

<p>
The fairy prince of her dream, however, came at last in the person of an old
man of three score years and ten, and she snapped him up in a trice. No doubt,
like all Stirmingham, she entertained the most fabulous ideas of
Sternhold’s wealth.
</p>

<p>
These dreams were destined to be rudely shattered. She seems to have had pretty
much her own way at first. Doubtless the old man was as wax in her hands, till
his former habits began to pull at him. She had one good trait at all events,
if it could be called good—the first use she made of her new position was
to provide for her family, or rather for the only member of it in England.
</p>

<p>
This was Aurelian Marese, her brother, who must have been a man of some talent
and energy, for despite all obstacles of poverty he contrived to pass his
examination and obtain a diploma from the College of Surgeons. He came to
Stirmingham, and with the assistance of Sternhold’s purse set up as a mad
doctor, in plain parlance, or in softer language, established a private lunatic
asylum. Oddly enough, it would seem that notwithstanding the immense population
of the city, there was not till that time any establishment of the kind in the
place, and the result was that Aurelian prospered. He certainly was a clever
fellow, as will be presently seen, though some fancy he over-reached himself.
When at last Sternhold, worn out with the unwonted gaieties into which Lucia
plunged him, showed unmistakable signs of weariness, and desired to return to
Stirmingham, she yielded with a good grace. She reckoned that he could not last
long, and it was her game to keep him in good temper; for she had learnt by
this time that he had the power to dispose of his property just as he chose.
</p>

<p>
We can easily imagine the restlessness of this creature confined in the dull
atmosphere of three or four rooms at Dodd’s Hotel, South Street. But she
bore it, and to her it was a species of martyrdom—the very reverse of
what she had pictured.
</p>

<p>
After a while, as time went on, whispers began to fly about—people
elevated their eyebrows and asked questions under their breath, exchanged nods
and winks. The fact was apparent; Sternhold could scarce contain himself for
joy. There was an undoubted prospect of The Heir. The old man got madder than
ever—that is, in the sense of self-laudation. He could not admire himself
sufficiently. The artful woman played upon him, you may be sure; at all events
there was a deed of gift executed at this time conveying to her certain
valuable estates lying outside the city, and tolerably unencumbered. Why she
came to select those particular estates which were not half so valuable as
others she might have had, was known only to herself then; but doubtless
Aurelian had heard about the Yankee claims, and advised her to take what was
safe. These estates were, in fact, bought with old Romy’s money made by
the nail factory, and were quite apart from the rest.
</p>

<p>
About this time, also, Sternhold left Dodd’s Hotel. This was another
evidence of her power over him. The best joke was, that although there was old
Romy’s country mansion about five miles from Stirmingham, although
Sternhold had since purchased four other mansions, and had nominally street
upon street of houses in the town, he had not a place to take his wife to. He
was obliged to rent one of his own houses of the company who had built it on a
building lease.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Sternhold now had her great wish gratified to some extent. She was the
observed of all observers. They tell you tales now in Stirmingham of her
extravagance, and the lengths she went. Her carriages, her horses, her
servants, her dinners, parties, and what not, were the one topic of
conversation. Even old-fashioned, straitlaced people found their objections
overcome by curiosity, and accepted her invitations.
</p>

<p>
Old Sternhold was never visible at these gatherings; but he rejoiced in them.
He was proud of his wife. He looked upon her as a prodigy. He gave her the
reins. But personally he practically returned to his old habits. He still
retained his old apartments at Dodd’s; and there he might be found, at
almost all hours, sitting at his desk, and eagerly, joyously receiving every
visitor who came to tell him of some fresh extravagance, some fresh frolic of
his wife’s!
</p>

<p>
How was all this expenditure supported, since his actual income was so small?
By a series of loans, which there were always men ready to offer, and whose
terms Sternhold always signed. Once or twice he did remonstrate, but darling
Lucia went into tears, and her brother Aurelian assured him that, in her state
of health, any vexation was dangerous, etc. Aurelian, through the Sternhold
connexion, was now a fashionable physician.
</p>

<p>
At last the event happened, and a son was born. The memory of the week
succeeding that day will not soon pass away in Stirmingham.
</p>

<p>
Old Sternhold, himself a most temperate man, declared that he would make every
one in the city tipsy; and he practically succeeded. He had barrels of ale and
gallons of spirits and wine offered free to all comers at every public-house
and tavern. He had booths erected in an open field just outside the town, for
dancing and other amusements, and here refreshments of all kinds were served
out gratis.
</p>

<p>
The police were in despair. The cells overflowed, and would hold no more, and
the streets reeled with drunken men, and still more drunken women.
</p>

<p>
This saturnalia reigned for four days, and would soon have culminated—at
least, so the police declared—in a general sack of the city by the
congregated ruffians. A detachment of dragoons was actually sent for, and
encamped in Saint George’s Square, with their horses and arms ready at a
moment’s notice. But it all passed off quietly; and from that hour
Sternhold, and more particularly the infant son, became the idol of the
populace.
</p>

<p>
They still look back with regret to those four days of unlimited licence, and
swear by the son of Sternhold.
</p>

<p>
This boy was named John Marese Baskette, but was always called Marese.
Singularly enough, the birth of this child, which one would have prophesied
would have completed the hold Lucia had over the father, was the beginning of
the difficulties between them. It began in his very nursery. Proud of her
handsome figure, and still looking forward to popular triumphs, Lucia flatly
refused to nurse the infant herself.
</p>

<p>
This caused a terrible quarrel. Old Sternhold had old-fashioned ideas. But
there is no need to linger on this. Lucia, of course, had her own way, and
Sternhold retired to sulk at Dodd’s Hotel. From that time the chink
widened, and the mutual distrust strengthened.
</p>

<p>
There never was any real doubt that the boy was legitimate; but some devil
whispered the question in Sternhold’s mind, and, he brooded over it. I
say some devil, but, in actual fact, it was one of those parasites who have
been once or twice alluded to. Is there anything that class will stop at in the
hope of a few formal lines in a rich man’s will?
</p>

<p>
It was their game to destroy Lucia. The plan was cunningly formed. As if by
accident, passages in Lucia’s previous life, when she was a stroller,
were alluded to in Sternhold’s presence.
</p>

<p>
He grew excited, and eager to hear more; to probe her supposed dishonour. The
parasites distinctly refused; it was too serious a matter. Still, if he wished
to hear—it was common talk—all he had to do was to go into the
billiard rooms. Some of the fellows there did not know him by sight, and they
were sure to talk about it.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold went. Of all the sights in the world, to see that old man making a
miserable attempt to play billiards while his ears were acutely listening to
the infamous tales purposely started to inflame him, nothing could be more
deplorable. The upshot was he grew downright mad, but not so mad that anything
could be done with him. He watched over Lucia like a hawk. She could not move;
her life became really burdensome.
</p>

<p>
It must be remembered that at that time she really was, though wild enough in
blood, perfectly stainless in fact. The temper in the woman was long
restrained. In the first place, she wanted his money; in the next place, there
was her son, whom she loved with all the vigour of her nature. She bore it for
a year or two, then the devil in her began to stir.
</p>

<p>
Old Sternhold, who had watched and inquired hour by hour all this time, had
found nothing wrong; but this very fact was turned against her by those devils,
his lickspittles. They represented that this was part of her cunning—that
she had determined he should have no hold upon her, in order that her son might
inherit. They reminded Sternhold that, although he could not divorce her, he
could alter his will. Here they rather overshot the mark, because he began to
reflect that if he cut off his son the old question would arise—To whom
should he leave his city, as he called it?
</p>

<p>
The miserable dilemma haunted and worried his already weakened brain and body
till he grew a shadow, and Lucia had hopes that he would die. But he did not;
in a month or two the natural strength of his constitution brought him round.
</p>

<p>
All this time Lucia was in dread about his will. Aurelian astute and cunning as
he was hardly knew what to advise or how to act. He had his spies—for he
was wealthy now to a certain degree, and could afford it. He had his strong
suspicions that some of the companies who had leased the property for building
had a hand in the persecution of Lucia, and in the inflammation of
Sternhold’s jealousy. It was certainly their interest to get the boy
disinherited. Aurelian began to grow seriously alarmed. Sternhold was stronger
and better—perhaps if he had had Aurelian for physician he would not have
recovered so fast; but with his distrust of Lucia, came an equal distrust of
her brother, and he would not acknowledge him.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian looked at it like this: Sternhold was now about seventy-five, and had
no organic disease. His father, Romy, had lived to a ripe old age; his
grandfather, the basket-maker, though shot in the prime of life, came of a
hardy, half-gipsy stock. The chances were that Sternhold, with all the comforts
that money could buy, would live another ten years. This very worry, this
jealousy, by keeping his mental faculties alive, might contribute to longevity.
In ten years, in a year, in a month, what might not happen?
</p>

<p>
His greatest fear was in Lucia herself, who had shown signs of late that she
must burst forth. If she did, and without his being near her, there was no
knowing what indiscretion she might not commit. It was even suspicious that
Sternhold had recovered. It looked as if he had made up his mind, and had
signed a will averse to Lucia’s interest and his son’s—had
settled it and dismissed it. This was a terrible thought, this last. When he
suggested the possibility of it to Lucia, you should have seen her. She raved;
her features swelled up and grew inflamed; her frame dilated; her blood seemed
as if it would burst the veins: till at last she hissed out, “I’ll
kill him!” and fell fainting.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian determined one point at once. There must be no more delay; action was
the order. But what? Suppose the worst. Suppose the will already made, and
against Lucia’s interests, what was the course to be taken? Why, to
accumulate evidence to invalidate it. <i>Prove him mad</i>!
</p>







<h3>Eight.</h3>

<p>
The idea having been once entertained, grew and grew, till it overshadowed
everything else. The singular circumstance then happened of one man slowly and
carefully collecting evidence during another’s lifetime to prove him
insane the moment he died.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian placed his principal reliance upon the violent jealousy Sternhold had
exhibited. So vehement and irregulated a passion founded upon mere phantasms of
the imagination, was in itself strong presumptive proof of an unsound mind. He
had no difficulty in finding witnesses to Sternhold’s outrageous conduct.
The old man had been seen walking up and down the street, on the opposite side
of the pavement to the house in which Lucia lived, for hours and hours at a
time, simply watching. He had been heard to use violent and threatening
language. He had made himself ill. The mind was so overwrought by excitement
that it reacted upon the body, and it was some time before the balance was
restored—if indeed it could ever be restored.
</p>

<p>
There were many trifling little things of manner—of
fidgetiness—absurd personal habits—which, taken in conjunction with
the bad temper he had displayed, went to make up the case. Aurelian added to
this the vanity Sternhold had of late openly indulged in. This was notorious,
and had become a by-word.
</p>

<p>
But when Aurelian had written all this out upon paper—when he had, as it
were, prepared his brief—his shrewd sense told him that in truth it was
very weak evidence. Any lawyer employed for the defence could easily find
arguments to upset the whole.
</p>

<p>
Day by day, as he thought it over, his reliance upon the insanity resource grew
less and less—and yet he could not see what else there was to do. He
racked his brain. The man, like others, was in fact fascinated by the enormous
property at stake: he could not get it out of his mind. It haunted him day and
night. He ransacked his memory, called up all his reading, all his observation,
all that he had heard—every expedient and plan that had come under his
notice for gaining an end.
</p>

<p>
For a time, however, it was in vain. It is often the case that when we seek an
idea it flies from us, and will not be constrained, not even by weeks of the
deeply-pondering state. Often the more we think upon a subject, the less we
seem to see our way clear. And so it was with him.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes a little change of scene, even a little manual exercise, will
stimulate the imagination. So it was with him.
</p>

<p>
He had an important and serious case to attend—a rich patient underwent
an operation at his hands, and the physician grew so absorbed with his delicate
manipulation and in genuine delight in his own skill, that Lucia and the
property passed for a day or two completely out of his memory. This was
followed by profound slumber, and next morning he awoke with the answer to the
great question staring him in the face.
</p>

<p>
If Sternhold was not mad enough now, why not drive him mad? If he was driven
frantic and shut up in an asylum, Lucia’s son would to a certainty
inherit the property. Possibly he (Aurelian) might be appointed
trustee—he, as uncle, would be a guardian, and probably the only one. He
might also have the pleasure of receiving Sternhold into his own retreat for
lunatics; and so, while furthering the interests of his sister and nephew, do
himself a good turn. The idea enraptured him.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian possessed the true scientific mind which is incapable of feeling. Some
thinkers believe that the true artistic mind, the highest artistic mind, is
also incapable of feeling. It is so absorbed in its own realisation of one
idea, that it loses all consciousness of possible suffering in others. He never
doubted for an instant that it was in his power to attain the proposed
object—it was only to <i>let Lucia loose</i>. Let her loose—a
little way. Let her loose under strict supervision—under the constant
surveillance of himself, his son, a youth of twenty whom he was training up in
the right road, and perhaps of other witnesses.
</p>

<p>
There was such a thing as divorce—this might not destroy the
child’s right, but it would place him out of Lucia’s hands. There
must be no handle for Lucia’s enemies to grasp at. She must be manoeuvred
so as to make Sternhold frantic without committing herself.
</p>

<p>
Lucia was aflame for such a course. She had restrained herself for years. She
was burning to be free, on fire for “life” and excitement; above
all, for admiration, for praise—the intoxicating breath of the multitude
that cheers to the echo! The Stage! the dance—music—the fiery gaze
of a thousand eyes following each motion! There must have been something of the
true artist in her. The grandest position, the most unlimited wealth, would not
have satisfied her without the stage.
</p>

<p>
She had married Sternhold in the hope of appearing as other women did in the
theatres owned by their lovers. She had tried to broach the subject to
Sternhold; he had held up his hands in horror, and she constrained herself and
bided her time.
</p>

<p>
Nearly four years now—four years! The coarse jests, the loud laughter,
the shouts and screams and cat-calls of the low threepenny gaff or music hall
from which she had been snatched—even such a life as that seemed to her
far, far superior to this irksome confinement, this slavery which was not even
gilded. Aurelian was right in his conjecture that she could not be much longer
held in—she must burst out.
</p>

<p>
Half-formed schemes had been working themselves into shape in her mind for
months past. She would leave her boy with Aurelian, take her jewels and sables,
sell them, borrow money upon the estate which Sternhold had made hers by deed
of gift, go to London or Paris, and plunge headlong into “life,”
paying any price for the one grand ambition of her existence.
</p>

<p>
The craving—the <i>fury</i>, it might almost be called—the furious
desire for admiration from men which seized upon her at times, would certainly,
sooner or later, have hurled her on to a desperate step.
</p>

<p>
At this moment Aurelian came with his carefully-considered plan. She met him
open-armed. With one blow she could avenge herself upon Sternhold, with one
blow gratify herself and destroy him—destroy him body and soul. This
moment—this hour!
</p>

<p>
But not so fast. First, Aurelian obtained the money—no small sum. Next,
said he, this thing must not be done by halves. It was useless for her to
appear on some small stage; she must at one bound become the talk of all the
town. This required care, thought, and organisation. Those great successes that
seemed so suddenly attained without an effort, as by a wave of the hand, had
really been preceded by months and months of preparation, and depended in great
part upon the matured judgment and clever advice of men who had watched the
public for years.
</p>

<p>
Impatient as she was, Lucia again controlled herself, and did as she was bid.
Aurelian made it his business first to discover where she could appear with
most effect. He soon selected the place, Paris! he obtained an interview with
the proper authorities, and confided to them a part of his secret. They saw
their way to profit, and agreed.
</p>

<p>
The next thing was the character she should take, and the second, the season.
This last the manager, or rather owner, who was in raptures with the thing,
easily decided. It must be at the height of the Paris season. He was a popular
man, who could gather together a mighty crowd of his own acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
If poor Sternhold, sitting in his apartment at Dodd’s Hotel, could have
heard these “fast” young men discussing the approaching appearance
of his wife, Aurelian would have gone no further.
</p>

<p>
The choice of character Aurelian insisted upon deciding, and he chose Lady
Godiva. As has been stated, Lucia had extraordinary hair, both for length and
abundance, and, unlike long hair generally, it was curly. Had it been fine and
delicate hair she could have boasted that few women in Europe could equal her.
The coarseness of its texture would not be visible upon the stage.
</p>

<p>
She had really a magnificent figure. The character of Lady Godiva was one
exactly fitted for her. It is needless to say that there was little or no
acting—no study of parts, no insight into the meaning required, as in the
case of Shakespeare’s heroines. The piece was simply a spectacle devised
to bring out one central figure into the boldest relief.
</p>

<p>
The greatest difficulty the conspirators—for so they may be fairly
called—had to contend with was the necessity of keeping Sternhold
completely in the dark, and yet at the same time getting together a large
audience, which could only be done by advertising. But Aurelian was capable of
dealing with more difficult dilemmas than this. His plan was very simple and
yet effective. The manager had a piece in his <i>répertoire</i> which,
owing to the fame or infamy of a certain fascinating lady, was the rage of the
town. Suddenly this creature disappeared—went off to Vienna with a titled
gentleman—and after blazing as a meteor of the first water there for a
short time, as suddenly dropped out of sight altogether.
</p>

<p>
The manager, at Aurelian’s suggestion, gave out that this lady had turned
up, and was going to again act at his house on a certain night.
</p>

<p>
The excitement was intense. It was an awful falsehood, for the poor girl was in
reality dead. (She met with her death under some strange and suspicious
circumstances, which were, by influence, suppressed.) Her beauty, great as it
was, had lost its charm in the tomb; yet her name, in flaring letters, was
prominent all over Paris.
</p>

<p>
The deception was kept up to the very end; and the company of the theatre, by
dint of double pay, were got to carry it out to perfection. An exceptional
number of waiters were, however, hired, and no one but the manager and Aurelian
had any idea what the object of this troop of apparently idle fellows could be.
</p>

<p>
The house filled to the last seat. The poor dead girl’s name was on every
lip—her frailties were discussed with horrid flippancy; the orchestra
began, and Lucia Marese Baskette robed, or rather unrobed, as Lady Godiva.
</p>

<p>
The owner of the theatre was there, and with him a whole host of men about
town, most of whom were partly in the secret, but not quite.
</p>

<p>
Just before the time arrived for the curtain to rise, this troop of idle
waiters entered the arena, swarmed into the boxes, into the galleries and pit,
distributing to every single individual who had entered a handbill, announcing
that, instead of Miss, “Mrs Sternhold Baskette, the beautiful wife of
Sternhold Baskette, Esq, the richest man in the world, the owner of twenty
millions sterling worth of property, would appear as Lady Godiva; a part for
which her splendid physique and magnificent hair peculiarly fitted her.”
At the same moment a large poster was put out in front of the curtain, bearing
the same announcement.
</p>

<p>
The effect was singular. The house, which had been full of noise before, became
as still as death. People were astounded. They could not believe it possible;
yet, at the same time, they knew that the manager dared not play a trick.
Theatres had been wrecked before now by indignant audiences. They waited in
silence.
</p>

<p>
The curtain rose. I cannot pause to describe the gradual enthusiasm which
arose, nor to draw a picture of the grand <i>tableau</i>. But there are many
living who remember that memorable night, who declare that anything equal to it
has never been seen upon the stage.
</p>

<p>
Lucia rode on a milk-white palfrey, and looked extraordinarily handsome. The
house rose—the audience went mad. Recalled and recalled, again and again
that white palfrey paced to and fro, and the mighty multitude would not allow
the scene to pass.
</p>

<p>
The mesmeric influence of the excitement filled Lucia with a glowing beauty;
with a brilliance which made her seem a goddess—of her order. No one
remarked whether the piece was properly gone through after this. I think it was
not. From all that I can learn, I believe the audience watched Godiva to and
fro till the palfrey or its rider grew exhausted, and then left <i>en
masse</i>.
</p>

<p>
Paris was aflame next day. The papers said nothing—they were wise. There
is, however, something more powerful even than the newspaper—it is
conversation. Lucia had got conversation—her name was heard everywhere.
It was not only the acting, or show—it could not be called
acting—it was the fact of her position as Sternhold’s wife. She
stood upon the pinnacle of his fame for wealth, brazen and shameless in the
eyes of the world. Brazen and shameless, yet secure; for Aurelian never left
her. He watched her himself. His son—his paid servants—did the
same; not from fear of her indiscretion, but in order to appear as witnesses if
any proceedings should take place.
</p>

<p>
Next night and next night, and again on the third night, this extraordinary
spectacle was repeated. The crowds that came to the doors could not be
admitted. But by this time the leading papers had felt the pulse of the
people—not the excitable populace, but the steady <i>people</i>. With one
consent they rushed at the exhibition with lance in rest. Improper was the
softest insinuation. They were undoubtedly right. The moment they took this
tone all the press followed, and before the week was over those who had the
power had prohibited the performance.
</p>







<h3>Nine.</h3>

<p>
The exhibition was stopped, but the end had been attained—Lucia was
famous. The manager and Aurelian had foreseen the inevitable official veto, and
had prepared for it. They had arranged for her to appear as Cleopatra; it was a
part which could be made to suit her admirably by leaving Shakespeare’s
text out of the question, and studying spectacle instead.
</p>

<p>
It is a singular fact that Sternhold had no idea of what was going on until the
fourth or fifth day. He was told that Lucia had left Stirmingham with her
brother for a short visit to Paris, and paid little or no attention to it. For
the first day or two the papers had been silent. At last the news reached him.
</p>

<p>
What Dodd had previously feared now happened—he was struck down with a
slight attack of paralysis, which affected one side. Some persons said it was a
merciful infliction, as it prevented him from witnessing his wife’s
disgrace with his own eyes. They were wrong. His body was bent, but his mind
was torn with contending and frenzied passions. The sense of outrage—of
outrage upon his dignity—was perhaps the strongest. That after all his
labour and self-denial, after long, long years of slowly building up a property
such as his, which rendered him in his own estimation not one whit inferior to
a king; that he should be insulted, his name dragged in the dirt, his wife a
spectacle for all Paris!
</p>

<p>
Sternhold had the vaguest ideas of stage proprieties and theatrical morality.
He had not a doubt but that Lucia was already an abandoned woman. There were
plenty who urged upon him to commence a suit for divorce, though in reality it
was extremely doubtful whether there were sufficient grounds for anything
beyond a judicial separation.
</p>

<p>
But Sternhold was filled with one consuming desire—to see her with his
own eyes. Whether it was this passion, or whether it was the natural strength
of his constitution, certain it is that in a marvellously short time after the
attack, he had himself conveyed to Paris, and sat, a miserable, haggard,
broken-down old man, in a box at the theatre the same night, watching his wife
upon the stage. He did this night after night. A species of fascination seemed
to carry him there to sit silent, brooding over the utter wreck of his great
schemes.
</p>

<p>
After a while he went suddenly back to Stirmingham without a word, without so
much as seeking an interview with Lucia, or issuing any instructions as to what
was to be done. He went back to his old apartments at Dodd’s Hotel. He
shut himself up, refusing to see even the wretched parasites who had sown the
seed of this mischief. It was an instinctive attempt to return to the old, old
habit, the ancient self-concentration, apart from the world. But it failed. So
soon as ever he began to read his letters, to look into his accounts, every
figure, every transaction reminded him of Lucia and her extravagance; the
follies she had been guilty of, and the no less greater folly he had himself
yielded to in granting her every wish, thereby involving his affairs in the
most hopeless confusion. The attempt failed. He rushed again from his retreat
to seek her. Then he heard that she was in Vienna performing. He got there,
supported by his attendants. Doubtless the physical fatigue of the journey
irritated his nerves; at all events, there seems no doubt that when he reached
Vienna he was for the time absolutely mad.
</p>

<p>
He went to the theatre. He saw Lucia as Godiva, just as she had been seen in
Paris. He was alone in his box. Deliberately he levelled a pistol, resting the
barrel upon the edge of the balustrade. As the incense of praise and adulation
rose up, as the pageant moved to and fro, the deadly weapon was aimed at the
central figure. He fired, and the house was in commotion.
</p>

<p>
Those who know what happens when a full theatre is alarmed and excited will
require no description; those who have not seen it cannot imagine it.
</p>

<p>
A second report, and the curling smoke caused a rush to the box, and the
occupant was found upon the floor, as was thought, dead. Lucia alone was calm
and cool. The bullet had not passed even near her; the distance was great and
the aim unsteady; the ball had struck a screen, and did no injury. She
dismounted and advanced to the footlights, extended her hands, and in a few
words begged the audience to be calm. Speedily they saw her thus, as it were,
in their very arms.
</p>

<p>
The theatre rang with acclamation. If it had been a scene prepared it could not
have succeeded better.
</p>

<p>
There were threats and loud cries of rage against the man who had fired at her.
</p>

<p>
“Do not injure him,” she said, at the top of her full, deep voice;
“he is mad!” For she guessed in a moment who it was.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes the whole thing was understood. Continental people are quick
at comprehending—an old husband, a young wife—bah! An attempt first
at murder, then at suicide—bah! What could he have done better calculated
to put Lucia upon the pedestal of fame?
</p>

<p>
Sternhold was not dead; not even injured. The ball he had fired at himself had
not touched him. He had fallen exhausted. When he became physically conscious,
he was raving mad.
</p>

<p>
There was no doubt about it this time. It was a pitiable sight.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian insisted upon seeing him: even he shuddered. The old man was muttering
gibberish to himself. Half his grey hair was gone, for before he could be
stayed he had dragged it out. His arms and limbs were pinioned, but his body
shook with a trembling convulsive movement. The deed was done.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian braced himself up, and hastened at once to Lucia. He knew he should
have a struggle with her, and hoped that in the conflict he should forget the
sight he had left. He had determined to at once withdraw her from the stage.
The victory was won; there must be no more risk.
</p>

<p>
The conflict between the brother and sister was terrible. She raged, her frame
swelled; she had tasted triumph, and the draught is more intoxicating even than
the taste of blood. She would go on.
</p>

<p>
But he was resolute, and he won. That very day he took her to
England—took is the right word, for it was necessary to use physical
force at times. He got her to her house at Stirmingham, and never left her till
she had grown more composed.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold was in an asylum. Aurelian thought that he would surely die; but he
did not.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian then began to scheme to get him in his own “retreat.”
Possession was nine points of the law. He went to Vienna at once before any one
guessed his object, obtained the proper permit, and in six days deposited the
wretched being in his asylum in the suburbs of Stirmingham. Once there, thought
Aurelian, let them get him out if they can.
</p>

<p>
The fact was soon known; and there was an excitement. The parasites,
disappointed and raging, did their best to inflame the populace. There was a
growl, and the police began to prepare for an attack upon the asylum; but,
after all, the moment any of them reflected, they said, “Why, it’s
all right; the poor fellow is mad. He could not be in better hands.” The
plan of a popular tumult fell through.
</p>

<p>
The parasites next tried the law, but found that Aurelian had been before them:
he had all the proper documents; he could not be touched.
</p>

<p>
Next the companies began to stir. They were uncertain what to do, and whether
it was better for their interests that Sternhold should be in his
brother-in-law’s custody or not.
</p>

<p>
That astute gentleman very soon learnt what was passing in their minds, and he
had a very good conception of what could be effected by powerful combination.
</p>

<p>
He opened negotiations with them. He pointed out to them privately that the
real point at issue was not Sternhold, but the boy—the heir—for no
one doubted the legitimacy. Who was to have the custody of the heir?
</p>

<p>
Clever Aurelian hoped that by making friends with the companies who held the
building leases that there would be no opposition to his holding the
boy—to his guardianship of the estate. He had strong grounds to go upon.
To all intents and purposes he was the nearest relation. If the boy died, and
no son of the phantom brother of Romy turned up, <i>perhaps</i> he might have a
claim to the estate.
</p>

<p>
He gave the companies to understand that if he had the guardianship of the boy
their interests should be most carefully studied.
</p>

<p>
They appeared favourable. The step was taken. The boy remained with his mother;
his mother remained in her house, seeing Aurelian daily, and indeed watched by
his <i>employés</i>.
</p>

<p>
No change took place. Aurelian congratulated himself that all was going on
favourably. The boy, who had little or no idea of the meaning of the word
“father,” was constantly at Aurelian’s residence—the
asylum where his parent was confined—playing with Aurelian’s son,
who was carefully instructed to please him, and indeed was sharp enough already
to require little instruction.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold lingered in his melancholy state. He was no longer
violent—simply dejected. He did not seem able to answer the simplest
question. If asked if he was hungry, he would stare, and say something relating
to his school-days.
</p>

<p>
And this was the man who had built Stirmingham. For five years he remained in
this state, and then suddenly brightened up; and it was thought and
<i>feared</i> that he would recover the use of his faculties. It lasted but
three days. In that short time he wrote three important documents.
</p>

<p>
The first was a statement to the effect that he had wronged Lucia. He now saw
his folly—he had been led into his persecution of her by designing
people, and blamed himself for his subsequent conduct. He earnestly entreated
her forgiveness. The second was a species of family history, short but
complete, refuting the claims of the American Baskettes. They were indeed of
the same name, he wrote, but not of the same blood. The truth was that the
cotters who had lived in the Swamp, now covered with mansions, had no name.
They were half gipsies; they had no registered or baptismal name.
</p>

<p>
Will Baskette, who had been shot, was the chief man among them, and gradually
they came by the country people to be called by his name. They were not blood
relations in any sense of the term. This paper also gave the writer’s
views of his transactions with the Sibbolds and the cotters or
“Baskettes,” and concluded with the firmly expressed
conviction—the honest statement of a man near his end—that his
title was irrefutable, and he knew of no genuine claim.
</p>

<p>
The third document was his Will. For now it appeared that hitherto he had never
made a will at all. It was extremely short, but terse and unmistakable. It left
the whole of his property, real and personal (with the single exception of the
gift to Lucia), to his son, John Marese Baskette.
</p>

<p>
The will Aurelian took care was properly attested, and by independent witnesses
whom he sent for.
</p>

<p>
On the fourth day old Sternhold died, quietly and without a word. He was
buried, and hardly was he in the tomb before the battle began. The companies at
once cut off all connection with Aurelian. They had reckoned upon his managing
to get their terms at all events extended, as he had promised. The Corporation
refused any honours to the dead king, and all eagerly sought about for the
means of dividing the spoil.
</p>

<p>
After all their consultations, not all the subtlety of twenty solicitors could
suggest any feasible plan—the old man had baffled them at last. It was
useless to plead that he was insane, and actually in an asylum at the moment of
executing the will. What was the good even if such a plea was
successful—if the will was upset, the property would descend to the boy
just the same. There seemed no way of getting at it.
</p>

<p>
But at last a weak point was found. It was a time when a great deal of
commotion was made about the Roman Catholic question and the religious
education of minors. Now Lucia was certainly half a foreigner, and it was
believed she was a Catholic. Aurelian was certainly a Catholic. With all his
cunning he had not foreseen this, and he had allowed himself to become a
somewhat prominent member of the Catholic community in Stirmingham. He had no
religion, but it paid him. Catholics are rich people, and when rich people go
insane they are profitable. So he was caught in his own trap.
</p>

<p>
There was an agitation got up among the ultra-Protestant community. Funds were
started to release the heir from the clasp of Rome. The companies, the
Corporation, all joined in the outcry. The question was made a national one by
the newspapers. But there was one difficulty: the law required that there
should be a person to sue. After much trouble this person was selected in one
of the Baskettes of American origin, who had settled in Stirmingham, and
claimed to be a nearer relation than Aurelian.
</p>

<p>
The battle was long and furious, and cost heavy sums. No expense was spared on
either side, and the estate got still further encumbered. It promised to be a
drawn battle; but at last, having passed all the tribunals, it began to
approach the place of power, and to be discussed in the Ministerial Cabinet.
There was a man there who desired to obtain the Catholic vote of Ireland, and
the Aurelian party began to boast already of success. But this very boasting
spoilt their game. The Ministry lost the confidence of the people, the House
followed suit, a new Ministry came into place, and the final decision was
against the Catholic, or, as they termed themselves, legitimate party—for
they said the uncle and the mother were the legitimate guardians.
</p>

<p>
The result was in truth disappointing to all the parties. The boy was made a
ward of Chancery, proper receivers of the estate were appointed, and the
companies who had begun to exult were entrapped. The lad was taken from his
mother and uncle, and sent to Eton to prepare for college.
</p>

<p>
Thus a new element of complexity was added to the already chaotic state of this
vast estate.
</p>







<h3>Ten.</h3>

<p>
If ever there was a life that illustrated the oft-quoted phrase “poor
humanity,” it was that of Sternhold Baskette. But this is not the place
to moralise—we must hasten on. The orchestra has nearly finished the
overture; the play will soon begin.
</p>

<p>
Lucia had now no longer any reason for restraint. Her boy was safe—safe
as the laws of a great country could make him—certain to inherit a
property which by the time he was forty would be of value surpassing
calculation. She rejoiced in it, gloried in it. To her it was more welcome than
the confirmed guardianship of Aurelian would have been, because it left her
free.
</p>

<p>
The lad was at Eton, and happy—far happier than he could have been
elsewhere. His mother immediately commenced a course which led her by a rapid
descent to the lowest degradation.
</p>

<p>
She returned to Paris. Aurelian felt it was useless now to interfere, neither
could he afford more expense.
</p>

<p>
She easily got upon the stage again, and became more popular than ever. At the
age of forty she was even more handsome than in her youth. Her features had
been refined by the passage of time and by the restraint to which she had been
subjected. Her form was more fully developed.
</p>

<p>
It is unpleasant to linger on this woman’s disgrace. She formed a
<i>liaison</i> with a rich foreign gentleman, retired with him from Paris after
a time, and the <i>Stirmingham Daily Post</i>, which pursued the Baskettes with
unmitigated hatred year after year, did not fail to chronicle the birth of a
son.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian, baffled, was not beaten. He was a resolute and patient man. Like the
famous Carthaginian father, he brought up his son and educated him to consider
the Baskette estates as the one object of his attention—only in this case
it was not for destruction, but for preservation.
</p>

<p>
When young John Marese Baskette, the heir, after distinguishing himself at
Eton, was sent higher up the Thames to Oxford, Aurelian immediately placed his
son, Theodore Marese, at the same college.
</p>

<p>
The result was exactly as he had foreseen. The heir formed a bond of
friendship—such as it is in these days—with Theodore. Their one
topic of conversation was the estate.
</p>

<p>
John was full of the most romantic notions. He was in youth a really exemplary
lad—clever, hard-working, winning to himself the good will of all men.
Theodore had a genuine liking for his cousin—then, at all events, though
probably in after life the attachment he professed was chiefly caused by self
interest.
</p>

<p>
John was full of ambitious dreams. His vivid imagination had been worked upon
by the talk among his companions about the famous owner of twenty millions
sterling—his father. Upon an old bookstall he obtained a copy of
“The Life of Sternhold Baskette,” now out of print. It inflamed him
to the uttermost. There was good metal in the boy if he had only had friends
and parents to put it to proper use. He formed the most extraordinary schemes
as to what he would do with this wealth when he became of age, and stepped at
one bound into the full enjoyment of it, as he supposed he should.
</p>

<p>
It was all to be used for the alleviation of the misery of the world, for the
relief of the poor, for the succouring of the afflicted, the advancement of all
means that could mitigate the penalties attaching to human existence.
</p>

<p>
As time wore on, however, these benevolent intentions received their first
check.
</p>

<p>
He reached his twenty-first birthday. He claimed his birthright, and was
refused. Briefly, the reason was because the companies and the American
claimants had entered pleas, and because also the property was terribly
encumbered, and would require long years of nursing yet before it could be
cleared, and this nursing the higher Courts insisted upon.
</p>

<p>
Instead of the magnificent income he expected, the young man received two
thousand pounds per annum only. It struck his nature a heavy blow, and did much
to pervert it, for he looked upon it in the sense of a shameful injustice. With
Theodore he left college; at all events he was now his own master, and entered
“life.”
</p>

<p>
Every one knows what “life” is to a young man of twenty-one with
two thousand a year certain—the power of borrowing to a wide margin, and
no monitor to check and retard the inevitable course.
</p>

<p>
Theodore was much older—fully thirty at this time; but he was as eager
for enjoyment, and perhaps more so.
</p>

<p>
To make the story short, they ran through every species of
extravagance—visited Paris, Vienna, and all the continental centres of
dissipation.
</p>

<p>
Ten whole years passed away. John Marese Baskette was by this time a thorough
man of the world, deeply in debt, brilliant and fascinating in manner, false
and selfish to the backbone. He inherited his mother’s beauty. A tall,
broad, well-made man, dark curling hair, large dark eyes, and large eyelashes,
bronzed complexion, which, when he was excited, glowed with almost womanly
brilliance; strong as a lion, gentle in manner, and fierce as a tiger under the
velvet glove. Polished and plausible, there were those who deemed him shallow
and wholly concerned with the pleasure of the hour; but they were mistaken.
</p>

<p>
John Marese Baskette had rubbed off all the soft and good aspirations of his
boyhood; but the ambition which was at the bottom of those schemes remained,
and had intensified tenfold. He was burning with ambition. The hereditary mind
of the Baskettes, their brain power, had descended to him in full vigour
(though hitherto he had wasted it), and he also inherited their thirst for
wealth. But his idea of obtaining it was totally opposed to the family
tradition. The family tradition was a private life devoted with the patience
and self-denial of a martyr to the accumulation of gold.
</p>

<p>
Marese’s one absorbing idea was power. To be a ruler, a statesman, a
leader, was his one consuming desire. As a ruler he thought, as a member of the
Cabinet, it would be easy for him to affect the market in his favour, for
Marese was a gambler already upon a gigantic scale. The Stock Exchange and the
Bourse were his arena.
</p>

<p>
The intense vanity of the man, which led him to seriously hope even for the
English Premiership, was, doubtless, a <i>trait</i> derived from his mother.
“If I had my rights,” he was accustomed to say to Theodore,
“I should be not only the wealthiest man in England, but in Europe and
America. My father’s property has more than doubled in value. In England
the wealthiest man at once takes a position above crowds of clever people who
have nothing but their talents. Without any conceit, I can safely say that I am
clever. A clever, wealthy man is so great a rarity that my elevation is a
certainty. But nothing can be done without money. At present my wealth is a
shadow only. The one thing, Theodore, is money. Our Stock Exchange labour is,
in a sense, wasted; our operations are not large enough. What we make is barely
sufficient to provide us with common luxuries (he did not pretend to say
necessities) and to keep our creditors quiet. Nothing remains for bolder
actions. I am thirty, and I have not yet entered the House.”
</p>

<p>
This last remark was always the conclusion of his reflections. In a sense, it
was like Caesar lamenting upon seeing a statue of Alexander—that he had
done nothing at an age when Alexander had conquered the world. He had not even
the means to fight the enemies who withheld his birthright from him. The
bitterness engendered of these wrongs, the constant brooding over the career
that was lost to him, obscured what little moral sense had been left in him
after the course of life he had been through; and the once gentle boy was now
ripe for any guilt. The verse so often upon the lips of the tyrant was for ever
in his mind, and perpetually escaped him unconsciously—
</p>

<p class="poem">
Be just, unless a kingdom tempt to break the laws,<br />
For sovereign power alone can justify the cause.
</p>

<p>
Like his father Sternhold, he looked upon the undisputed possession of such an
estate as conferring powers and position nothing inferior to that of a monarch.
His dislike to all things American—in consequence of the claims, now more
loudly proclaimed than ever, of the Baskettes from the States—grew to be
almost a monomania. He wished that the United States people had but one neck,
that he might destroy them all at once—applying the Roman emperor’s
saying to his own affairs.
</p>

<p>
His especially favourite study was “The Prince” of Machiavelli,
which he always carried with him. His copy was annotated with a scheme for
applying the instructions therein given to modern times—the outline of
the original requiring much modification to suit the changes in the
constitution of society. Some day he hoped to utilise the labours of the man
whose name has become the familiar soubriquet of the Devil.
</p>

<p>
Theodore, whom Aurelian had made qualify as a surgeon, was imbued with an
inherited taste for recondite research. He would return from a wild scene of
debauchery at early dawn, and drawing the curtains and lighting his lamp to
exclude daylight, plunge into the devious paths of forbidden science. Keen and
shrewd as he was, he did not disdain even alchemy, bringing to the crude ideas
of the ancients all the knowledge of the moderns. Cruel by nature, he excelled
in the manipulation of the dissecting knife, and in the cities upon the
Continent where their wanderings led them, lost no opportunity of practising
with the resident medical men, or of studying those wonderful museums which are
concealed in certain places abroad. Marese was the fiery charger, ready to dash
at every obstacle Theodore was the charioteer—the head which guided and
suggested. Yet all their concentrated thought could not devise a method by
which Marese might obtain the full enjoyment of his estate. Briefly, this was
the condition of Marese’s mind and his position, when the death of
Aurelian took place, and a letter reached them written by him in his last
hours, entreating their return to Stirmingham for reasons connected with the
estate. They went, and a woman went with them as far as London—a woman
whom we must meet hereafter, but who shall be avoided as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
They arrived at Stirmingham unannounced, and examined the papers which the
deceased had particularly recommended to their study. Aurelian, as has been
said, was baffled but not beaten. The fascination of the vast estate held his
mind, as it held so many others, in an iron vice. The whole of his life was
devoted to it. He had searched and searched back into the past, groping from
point to point, and he had accumulated such a mass of evidence as had never
been suspected.
</p>

<p>
He knew far more even than poor Sternhold, who had occupied himself exclusively
with the future.
</p>

<p>
Marese and Theodore, living quietly in the residence attached to the asylum for
the insane, which Aurelian had continued to keep, carefully studied these
papers by the light of the lucid commentary the dead man had left. It is
needless to recount the whole of the contents—most of them are known
already to the reader. But the substance of it all was that three great dangers
menaced the estate. The first was the claims of the Baskettes from America.
</p>

<p>
The evidence which Aurelian had collected was clear that the land they had
occupied in the Swamp had been practically theirs, since they had paid no rent;
but as to their power of handing it over to Sternhold, it was extremely
questionable. The second great danger was the claim of a new tribe that had
recently started up—the descendants of James Sibbold, who had also
expatriated themselves.
</p>

<p>
It was doubtful if the transfer made by their ancestors could be maintained,
and for this simple reason—it was doubtful whether James Sibbold himself
had any right to the property his sons sold to Sternhold. He was not the eldest
son. The eldest son, Arthur, had disappeared for a number of years; but there
was not the slightest proof that he had died childless. Far from it. Aurelian,
incessantly searching, had found out what no one else yet knew—that
Arthur had married, had had children, and that one at least of his descendants
was living but a short time since.
</p>

<p>
When Marese had read thus far his countenance turned livid, and Theodore feared
he would have fallen in a fit. The savage passions inherited from his mother
surged up in his frame, and overmastered him. He was ill for days, almost
unconscious—the shock was so great, his passion so fierce—but
presently recovering, read on.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian had traced Arthur in his wanderings, had traced his marriage—but
there was one loophole. Do what he might, Aurelian could not discover
<i>where</i> Arthur had married. It was in London, but a minute search failed
to discover the church, and the register could not be found.
</p>

<p>
This fact, and the fact of the long silence, the absence of any claim being put
forward, led Aurelian to believe that there really was no legal
marriage—that it was only reputed. He hoped as much, at all events.
</p>

<p>
There was another loophole—the deed which old Sibbold had so treasured in
his padlocked oaken chest—the deed which settled the inheritance (on the
female as well as the male)—had disappeared. Sternhold had searched for
it and failed. It was lost. If the marriage could not be proved, and if the
deed was really lost, then there was no danger from Arthur Sibbold’s
descendants; but there remained those “ifs.” Also, if
Arthur’s claim was put aside, then the succession would of course belong
to his brother James Sibbold’s descendants: but then again came in the
question—Could these Sibbolds sign away (to Sternhold) an inheritance
which at the time was <i>entailed</i>?
</p>

<p>
Aurelian finished with several hints and schemes which need not be gone into
here, and indeed were never carried out. But his one great point throughout was
a warning against the living descendant of Arthur Sibbold, whose name and
present address he had discovered and left for Marese, and against the
companies who held the leases. “For,” said he, “these
companies would foster any and every claim against the estate; anything to bar
the succession of Marese, the heir, in order to obtain a grant or extension of
time from the courts of law, to enable them to hold the property till the
succession to the estate was established.” These companies were so rich
and powerful that it was difficult to contend against them. Their strength was
money, their weapons were the various claimants.
</p>

<p>
“Therefore,” wrote Aurelian, “the first thing is money, and I
wish my property to be used freely for this end, convinced that you will do
Theodore full justice; and I bid you, if possible, to take the <i>weapons</i>
of the companies out of their hands. Without the claimants they are
powerless.”
</p>

<p>
These papers, and the facts and reflections they contained, made the deepest
impression upon Marese and Theodore. In secret they walked through the city of
Stirmingham, and marked its wealth, its vastness, its trade and population.
</p>

<p>
“And nearly all this is mine,” whispered Marese, pale as death in
his subdued excitement. He had to hold Theodore’s arm to sustain his
body, for, strong as he was, he trembled.
</p>

<p>
Next day they left for London, for Marese could not bear the Tantalus-like view
of the wealth which was and was not his. In London they thought and planned as
only such men seeking such an end can think and plan.
</p>







<h3>Eleven.</h3>

<p>
While Marese and Theodore are maturing their plans, it will conduce to the
easier comprehension of the horrible, complicated events which followed, if the
past history of the estate be briefly summed up in such a manner that this
chapter can be used for reference.
</p>

<p>
In the commencement, nearly a century previous to the present time, we have
seen old Sibbold, the morose miser, gloating over his money, and studying his
title-deeds. These gave him an unquestioned right to the farm he occupied, and
to the Swamp, or waste land, which had been squatted on by Will Baskette and
his companions. This right mainly depended, though not entirely, upon a certain
deed of entail. Without that deed Sibbold had still sufficient evidence to
prove his right to his farm, but not to the Swamp; without that deed there was
no fixed succession—that is to say, he could have devised it to any one
he chose.
</p>

<p>
There was, therefore, just the possibility that, hating his eldest son Arthur,
he had himself destroyed this deed, in order to prepare the way for his second
son, James. But against this supposition there was the known character of the
man, which led one to imagine that he would rather have died than give up the
smallest fraction of his possessions. At all events, this deed was missing, as
were several others of little or no value, such as expired leases of fields to
tenants, which had once been kept in Sibbold’s oaken press, under padlock
and key.
</p>

<p>
When Sibbold met with his death at the hands of highwaymen, the farm and waste
lands, in the natural course of things, would have passed to his eldest son,
Arthur, but he having disappeared, and not appearing to make a claim, James
Sibbold, the younger son, took the property. The majority of people always
thought, from the fact of Arthur’s not returning to claim his birthright,
that he had had a hand in the slaughter of old Will Baskette, and that his
conscience drove him away.
</p>

<p>
James Sibbold, after a while, married, and had several sons. In time he died,
and these sons, though married, still all remained living on the farmstead, or
in the outhouses; for as it was known that James’ right was doubtful,
they could not agree about the succession, and preferred to live like pigs
rather than go to law and have it settled, since the result was so uncertain.
At the same time the squatters, basket-makers, reed-cutters, clothes-peg
makers, etc, who resided in the Swamp which the rat had caused, had
considerably increased in numbers, and were always called, after their former
chief, by the name of Baskette.
</p>

<p>
This chief at the date of his death had two sons. The eldest went off with his
mother, and joined the original gipsy tribe; the youngest, whose name or
nickname was Romy, entered the service of the clergyman. The eldest was never
heard of more; but Romy prospered, and in early middle age bought an estate and
country mansion, not far from his birthplace.
</p>

<p>
It was he who opened up the concealed mineral wealth of coal and iron, and
thus, as everything goes by contradiction in this world, it happened that the
descendant of gipsies, notorious for their wandering habits and dislike of
houses, was the founder of one of the largest cities in the world.
</p>

<p>
He married with every legal formality, and his son, Sternhold Baskette, imbued
with the firmest convictions that in the future the young city would prosper to
an unprecedented extent, employed the whole of the wealth he inherited in
purchasing land and erecting houses.
</p>

<p>
In the course of his transactions he desired to purchase the Wick Farm, where
old Sibbold had dwelt, and the Swamp where the Baskette tribe flourished.
Finding the title of the vendors imperfect, he devised the strongest safeguard
he could think of, which was to make all the Sibbolds then living or known, to
sign one document, and all the reputed Baskettes to sign another. He then
transhipped them all to America—first, to get complete possession;
secondly, in the hope that they would never return to trouble him.
</p>

<p>
He proceeded to drain the Swamp, and to convert it into the Belgravia of
Stirmingham. But this project required an enormous expenditure, and just at
that moment the first railway to the place, which he had largely supported,
came to a standstill, and ate up all his available capital. When, therefore, a
return of commercial prosperity took place, he found it impossible alone to
complete the vast scheme of streets, squares, etc, which had been commenced.
</p>

<p>
Then the building lease plan was resorted to—the very keystone of all
this curious history. First, the Corporation of the city took a large slice of
the uncompleted property of him on a building lease for a term of years, on the
expiration of which the whole reverted to him or his heirs (practically his
heirs, as he was not likely to live to the age of 120 years).
</p>

<p>
After they had commenced building some uncertainty arose as to whether or no
they had the power to enter into such an agreement; they could bind themselves,
but could they bind their successors in office? This took place, it must be
remembered, long, long before the recent sanitary legislation, which gives such
extensive powers to local bodies.
</p>

<p>
In order to confirm their proceedings they obtained a private Act of
Parliament, which, when it was drawn up, seemed to be worded clearly enough.
But every one knows that after the lapse of thirty years or less, words in an
inexplicable manner seem to lose their meaning, and to become capable of more
than one interpretation. This is perhaps because the persons who read them are
influenced unconsciously by a series of circumstances which did not exist at
the time the document was composed.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, at the date when Marese and Theodore were thinking and scheming,
there had already been a great deal of contention over the precise scope of
several sentences in this Act: a part of which arose over the question of
repairs to the buildings, and partly as to whether, by a little straining, the
seventy years of the lease might not be construed to mean practically for ever.
</p>

<p>
This little straining was managed in this way. When did the lease commence? Had
not each successive Mayor got the right to say, “This lease, as
interpreted by the Private Act, means, not seventy years from the days of my
predecessor, but seventy years from the commencement of my term of
office.” By this way of looking at it, so long as there was a Mayor the
Corporation would always have seventy years to look forward to.
</p>

<p>
Of course all such reasoning was nothing but pure sophistry; but then most law
is sophistry, and sophistry when supported by a rich body of men and called
Vested Interest, is often much stronger than the highly belauded and really
feeble truth.
</p>

<p>
Here was a tough Gordian knot, to add to the already difficult question of
original title. But this was only the preface to the complications to follow.
There still remained, after the Corporation had taken a part, a huge howling
wilderness of streets with walls two feet high. Companies or syndicates were
formed (eight companies in all)—perhaps they had better be called in
modern parlance building societies—who took this howling wilderness on
the same system of building leases, to fall in at a certain date.
</p>

<p>
Apparently in this case it was all plain, straightforward sailing; but not so.
Sternhold Baskette got into difficulties over Railway Number 2, and had to
borrow money. He also had to borrow money to complete portions of the estate
which he had kept in his own hands, and to acquire lands just outside the city.
Lastly, he had to borrow money to support the extravagance of his wife. In the
aggregate these sums were something enormous.
</p>

<p>
At the moment of borrowing he was under the impression that he had dealt with
independent persons—with financiers, in fact, of London, being so assured
by his solicitors. These solicitors had had a pretty picking out of his
railways and estates; they had grown fat and prosperous upon him, and might,
one would have thought, have been trusted to serve him honestly.
</p>

<p>
But no—whenever was there a friendship formed in business? Ostensibly,
the financiers who advanced the cash were independent; in reality, they acted
for certain of these very aforesaid building societies who had taken the
building leases! Four at least of them had their money thus out upon good
security; and Sternhold, unknowingly at first, owed them a large fortune.
</p>

<p>
For their own interest they had proved easy creditors. They had not called in
the loans; not a fraction of the original sums borrowed from them to complete
Railway Number 2, to finish houses, buy fresh lands, to pay for Lucia’s
extravagance, had been repaid. Very little of the interest had been cleared
off; none while Sternhold lived. They knew that they were safe. The railway was
now paying a fair dividend, the houses and lands had trebled in value; as for
Lucia’s waste it was small in comparison—when they chose to call in
their money they could seize upon property to twice the amount due, even with
added interest.
</p>

<p>
But they did not choose to call in their money. The leases were now approaching
the day of expiration. They knew that the trustees of Sternhold’s estate
had not one tithe of the cash required to meet their demands: they would be
compelled to submit to one of two things—first, they must yield up a good
part of the estate, or they must grant an extension of the leases—either
of which would suit the societies exactly.
</p>

<p>
They intended to push matters in such a way as to compel the trustees to extend
the term, in order to retain both halves, as it were, of the estate under their
control. This was Gordian knot Number 3. How was the heir to come by his own
through all this? It was impossible, unless he could scrape together sufficient
money to pay off the loans which had been contracted by his father. He would
then be in a position to claim the property held by the trustees at the
expiration of the leases, which was now fast approaching.
</p>

<p>
The other four companies had got wind of this nice little arrangement, and it
upset them extremely. They had not been half so shrewd as their fellows, and
that was a bitter reflection. They foresaw their valuable properties passing
away from them, while the other societies held fast to their share. It was gall
and wormwood.
</p>

<p>
But they were not to be outdone in the Art of Entanglement. Sternhold was dead;
they could not lend him money. But the heir, our friend Marese, was living, and
living “fast;” and not only that, he was speculating heavily upon
the Stock Exchange. Here was a fine opening. With careful and judicious
management they bought up all Marese’s debts; they lent him money to a
large amount through their agents, keeping themselves in the background out of
sight; and they had gentlemen always on the watch on the Exchange, whose
business it was to tempt Marese into apparently good bargains with floating
paper.
</p>

<p>
Not content with this, they had still further secured themselves. They had
allied themselves with a certain powerful and enterprising railway company.
This company had hitherto been shut out of Stirmingham, and were extremely
desirous of getting access to it. These second four societies combined, and
declared that in the interests of the properties committed to their charge
(save the mark!) it was essential that there should be more direct railway
communication with a certain district which it is immaterial to name, and that
there should be a station close to their portion of the estate, the other
stations being at some distance. The enterprising railway company would
guarantee good terms if the trustees of the estate would enter into agreement
with them.
</p>

<p>
The upshot was that another Act of Parliament was obtained by the influence of
the said powerful railway company, authorising this line, station, and
agreement. It was now argued that this Act and agreement would override the
original building leases; especially as the railway company were prepared to
prove that they had not yet reaped any reasonable benefit, and, unless the
leases were extended, would be serious losers. As they had immense interest in
the House, they were likely enough to gain their point. Here were two more
Gordian knots, Numbers 4 and 5!
</p>

<p>
Then there was the list of claimants to the estate, which had now been swelled
from all parts of the world, and the series of suits and pleas, and Heaven
knows what other litigation threatened by them, making Gordian knot Number 6.
Finally, the estate was in Chancery. Knot Number 7.
</p>

<p>
Here was a pleasant prospect for the heir! To put all the rest on one side, on
the day that the building leases expired, and he stepped forward to claim his
rights, the building societies would present him with the following neat little
bill:—
</p>

<img src="images/world179.jpg" alt="" />

<p>
“After all,” said Marese to Theodore, as they planned and schemed,
and smoked cigars at 120 shillings the hundred, “after all, old fellow,
this is but one year’s income if I could only get possession. And I
believe we could finance the thing and raise the money without difficulty, if
it were not for those cursed, hateful claimants from America and elsewhere. The
Jews fight shy on account of the title difficulty. If we could but get rid of
those claimants!”
</p>







<h3>Twelve.</h3>

<p>
There was once a very wise man who invented what was considered a saying almost
inspired, which was afterwards inculcated as a most important lesson by mighty
princes upon their sons, and continues to be constantly quoted in our day with
approval—it is, that “Unity is strength.” But the strength of
the claimants to the Baskette estate consisted in the number of their scattered
forces.
</p>

<p>
All that Marese, the heir, could have desired was that by some means they could
be condensed into one person, and thus destroyed at a blow. They had increased
as the years went by in a geometrical ratio, till the total formed a small
battalion.
</p>

<p>
When the idea of making claims upon the estate first arose in America, there
were already quite fifty families who in one way or another thought they had
“rights.” About a dozen visited Stirmingham, and all but drove poor
old Sternhold frantic. That was a generation ago, and the tribe had nearly
trebled. Mothers of children who had the remotest possible chance of a share in
the prize took care to have them christened Baskette or Sternhold. There were
Sternhold Baskette Browns, Baskette Johnsons, Baskette Stirmingham Slicks,
English Baskette Williamsons, and every possible combination of Baskette.
</p>

<p>
Those who, either by the male or female side, really could show some species of
proof that they were descended from the seventeen squatters who were
transhipped to the States now numbered no less than one hundred and forty-three
individuals—men, women, and children. To distinguish themselves from
other claimants, they called themselves “The True Swampers.”
</p>

<p>
But in addition to these, there was a host of other Baskettes, who in one way
or another foisted in their names. There were Baskets, Bascots, Buscots,
Biscuits, Buschcotts, Bosquettes—every conceivable variation of spelling
from every State and territory, who declared that they were related to the
parent stem of Will Baskette, the squatter, who was shot by old Sibbold. These
might be called for distinction the pseudo-Baskettes.
</p>

<p>
Then among the True Swampers there was an inner circle, who professed to have
prominent “rights” on account of their progenitors having been more
nearly related to the original Will Baskette. They argued that the others were
not true Baskettes, and had only adopted that name from the chief, while they
were real blood Baskettes.
</p>

<p>
In addition, there was another host of people who made a virtue of proclaiming
that they were not named Baskette. They did not profess to be named
Baskette—they did not take a name which was not theirs! They were
Washingtons, Curries, Bolters, Gregorys, Jamesons, and so on. But they had
claims because their father’s wives were of the Baskette blood.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there was another sub-division who loudly maintained that half of the
original cotters who landed in New York were not Baskettes, but Gibbs, Webbes,
Colborns, and so on, and that they were the descendants of these people. And
there were some who went the length of declaring that they were descended from
two alleged illegitimate sons of old Romy Baskette!
</p>

<p>
The Baskette Battalion was therefore made up of—1st. The Pure Blood
Baskettes; 2nd. The True Swampers; 3rd. Demi-Baskettes, who had that name added
to another; 4th. Nominal Baskettes, whose names had an accidental resemblance;
5th. The Feminine Baskettes, descended from women of Baskette strain; 6th.
Independent Squatters, not Baskettes, but companions; 7th. Illegitimate
Baskettes!
</p>

<p>
Then there were the Sibbolds—such a catalogue! These had been slower to
wake up to their “rights” than the Baskettes, but when they did
discover them they came in crowds. First, there were the descendants, in a
straight line, of the eight sons of James Sibbold, shipped (six with families)
to New York. They had multiplied exceedingly, and there was no end to them. The
simply Sibbolds, as we may call them, numbered no less than two hundred and
eighteen, all told—men, women, and children. Every one of these had some
register, some old book—many of these books were worm-eaten copies of Tom
Paine’s “Rights of Man”—some piece of paper or other to
prove that they had the blood of James Sibbold in their veins.
</p>

<p>
Then there were all the ramifications, pretty much like the Baskette branches;
innumerable cadets distantly related, innumerable people whose wife’s
uncle’s mother or cousin’s name was Sibbold; and all the various
Sibbolde, Sibboldes, Sibald, Sigbeld, Sybels, Sibils, Sibelus, Sibilsons, <i>ad
libitum</i>. Illegitimate Sibbolds were as plentiful as blackberries, and all
ready to argue the merits of the case with revolver and bowie. If the Baskettes
made up a battalion, the Sibbolds formed an army!
</p>

<p>
Between these two great divisions there was the bitterest enmity. The Baskettes
derided the claims of the Sibbolds; the Sibbolds derided those of the
Baskettes. The Sibbolds told the Baskettes that they were an ill-conditioned
lot; if they had been respectable people, and really his relations, old
Sternhold would never have shipped them to America out of his sight. The
Baskettes retorted that the Sibbolds were ashamed to stay in England, for they
were the sons of a murderer; they were the descendants of a dastardly coward,
who shot a man through a window. The Sibbolds snarled, and pointed out that the
great chief of the Baskettes was nothing but a thief, caught in the act and
deservedly punished; a lot of semi-gipsies, rogues, and vagabonds. Their very
name showed that they were but basket-makers; they were not even pure gipsy
blood—miserable squatters on another man’s property.
</p>

<p>
Blows were not unfrequently exchanged in the saloons and drinking-stores over
these quarrels. The result was the formation of two distinct societies, each
determined to prosecute its own claim and to oust the other at all hazards. The
Baskette battalion relied upon the admitted non-payment of rent by their
forefathers to upset all subsequent agreements, and they agreed also that this
agreement which their forefathers had signed was not binding on the remote
descendants. The document was obtained by trickery, and the land was not put to
the use the vendors had understood it was to be put, as the representatives now
alleged, to simple agricultural purposes. Further, each of those who signed the
document only gave up his cottage and the small plot of garden round it; they
did not sell the waste land between the islands.
</p>

<p>
The Sibbolds principal argument was that their forefathers could not sign away
an entailed estate without previously cutting off the entail, and it was
acknowledged that this had not been done. But, said the Baskettes, there was a
question if the land ever was entailed; let the Sibbolds produce the deed, and
if it was not entailed, where was their claim?
</p>

<p>
Each of these divisions formed itself into a society, with a regular committee
and place of meeting, a minute-book to record accumulated evidence, legal
gentlemen to advise, corresponding secretaries, and Heaven knows what. They
actually issued gazettes—printed sheets of intelligence. There was the
<i>Baskette Gazette</i> and the <i>Sibbold Gazette</i>, which papers carefully
recorded all deaths, marriages, and new claims. There was a complete
organisation, and a—fine thing it was for the lawyers and some few sharp
young men.
</p>

<p>
Of late these societies had received more or less cordial overtures from the
eight building societies at Stirmingham who held the leases. The first four
societies encouraged the Baskette battalion, the second held out hopes to the
Sibbolds. The cunning building societies, without committing themselves,
desired nothing better than protracted litigation between these claimants and
the heir, in the certainty that meantime they should reap the benefit.
</p>

<p>
Among the American corps of claimants there were men of all classes—from
common labourers, saloon-keepers, etc, up to judges, editors, financiers,
merchants; and many of them were clever, far-seeing persons, who, without
putting any weight upon the somewhat strained “rights” they
professed to believe in, still thought that there was “something in it,
you know,” and money might be got by persistent agitation, if it was only
hush-money.
</p>

<p>
Throughout many turbulent States there was at one time quite a feeling aroused
against England (which added its venom to the unfortunate <i>Alabama</i>
business), as having unjustly kept what was due to American citizens. These
societies had their regular agents in Stirmingham and London, whose duty it was
to report every change that took place, every variation of the case, and to
accumulate evidence and transmit it. These bulletins were received by the
“caucuses,” and sometimes printed in the <i>Gazettes</i>.
</p>

<p>
Besides these regular organisations, who had money at disposal and were really
formidable, there were several free lances careering over the country,
representing themselves as the sons of the elder brother of Romy Baskette, the
brother who had disappeared with the gipsies. These were downright impostors,
and yet got a living out of the case. Several lecturers also promenaded the
States, who made a good thing of it by giving a popular version of the story,
illustrated by a diorama of incidents in the lives of the principal actors,
from the shooting of Will Baskette to the appearance of Lucia Marese as Lady
Godiva. It was singular that no one presented himself as a descendant of Arthur
Sibbold; he seemed to have been quite forgotten. So much for America.
</p>

<p>
From Australia there came, time after time, the most startling reports, as is
usual when any <i>cause célèbre</i> is proceeding in the Old
World. Now, it was a miner at the diggings who had made extraordinary
disclosures; now, some shepherd on a sheep-run, after a fit of illness, found
his memory returned, and recollected where important deeds were deposited.
</p>

<p>
Nothing, however, came of it. The principal seats of disturbance were America
and England; for England produced a crop of what we may call Provisional, or
Partial Claimants. Here and there, scattered all over the country—from
Kent to Cornwall, from Hampshire to Northumberland—were people of the
name of Baskette, which is a very ancient English cognomen, and to be found in
every collection of surnames.
</p>

<p>
Most of these were of little or no consequence, but one or two held good
positions as gentlemen or merchants. None of these latter made the shadow of a
pretence to the estate, but they were fond of speculating as to their possible
remote connection with the now famous Baskette stock; and some said that if
anything did turn up, if any practical results followed the American attempt,
it would be as well to be prepared to take a share in the spoil.
</p>

<p>
There were also at least three impostors—utter scoundrels, who obtained a
profusion of drink and some sustenance from credulous fools in tap-rooms by
pretending that they were descendants of the elder brother of Romy Baskette.
They had not the shadow of a proof, and ought to have been treated to a dose of
“cell.”
</p>

<p>
A gipsy tribe, a travelling clan which went about the country with shooting
galleries, merry-go-rounds, peep-shows, and so on, were in the habit of
proclaiming that they were the very identical tribe from whom offshoots settled
in the historical swamp at Wolf’s Glow, in order to attract custom.
</p>

<p>
Certain persons in and around Stirmingham, whose fathers or ancestors had sold
lands to Sternhold Baskette—lands now worth ten, and in some cases a
thousand, times the price he had given for them—had a fallacious idea
that if the title of the heir was upset, they would have a chance of regaining
possession, or at least of an additional payment for the property.
</p>

<p>
They formed themselves into a loosely-compacted society to protect their
interest. It was remarkable that in England, as in America, no one set up a
claim to be the descendant of Arthur Sibbold. The real danger was from America,
the land of organisation.
</p>

<p>
But in England there was a class of persons who, without possessing any
personal interest in the matter, made it their especial business to collect all
the “ana” that could be discovered, and gained a livelihood out of
their study of the case. More than one private inquiry office in London
received large fees from New York clients to make special investigations. The
credulity of mankind is exhibited in a striking manner in the support given to
these offices. How should they be supposed to be so devotedly attached to the
cause of one client? What is to prevent them having fifty, all with the same
end, and from selling the information gained from one to the other?
</p>

<p>
There were men who made it a speciality of their trade to collect all books,
pamphlets, pictures, lectures, genealogies, deeds, documents, letters, papers,
<i>souvenirs</i>—anything and everything, from Sternhold Baskette’s
old hat upwards, that could be twisted into relation with the case.
</p>

<p>
Those who have never had any leaning towards antiquarian research have no idea
of the enormous business done in this way—not only in reference to great
cases of this kind, but in reference to matters that would appear to an
outsider as absolutely not worth a thought. There is scarcely a scrap of
written or printed paper of the last century, or up to within fifty years of
the present date, which has not got its value to such a collector, for he knows
there will be fools to buy them. Sometimes it happens that an apparently
worthless piece of paper or parchment, bought as waste, turns out, under his
sharp eye, to be a really awkward thing for some owner of property unless he
purchases it.
</p>

<p>
There were lawyers in a peculiar way of business who did not disdain this
species of work, and presently they may cross our path. Such men were in
constant communication with people on the other side of the Atlantic, where
there is, year by year, an increasing desire manifested to trace out
genealogies.
</p>

<p>
The year in which, in the ordinary course of events, the building societies and
the Corporation must relinquish their expired leases was now fast approaching.
Some such person as has been described was seized with a brilliant idea, and
made haste to advertise it. Why should not all the claimants to the estate meet
on the disputed spot at this critical moment? Why should there not be a regular
family council, the largest and most important that had ever taken place? The
idea was a good one, and spread like wildfire. The newspapers took it up; the
American societies thought highly of it. Nothing like a grand demonstration.
</p>

<p>
The upshot was that Stirmingham began to look forward to the assembling of
these would-be monarchs of the city, which was finally, after much discussion,
fixed for the next New Year’s Day.
</p>

<p>
This New Year’s Day was fast approaching, while Marese and Theodore
planned.
</p>







<h3>Thirteen.</h3>

<p>
The grand family council was to be held at Stirmingham on the coming New
Year’s Day. How difficult it is to trace the genesis of an idea! It does
not seem to have any regular growth—to begin with a seed and cast out
roots, a stem, branches, leaves; it shoots now one way, now this, like those
curious creatures revealed by the microscope, or like the germs of fungi. Upon
the original thought odd branches are engrafted, accidental circumstances
suggest new developments, till at last the full completed idea bears no sort of
resemblance to what might have been expected from the embryo.
</p>

<p>
How the idea was first started neither Marese nor Theodore could tell, nor how
it was communicated from one to the other. There is a method of communication
which is not dependent upon direct speech; there is a way of talking at a
subject without mentioning it. When two clever men’s minds are full of
one absorbing topic it does not require formal sentences to convey their
conceptions. They did not seem even to actually talk of it, and yet it grew and
grew, till it overshadowed them like a vast gloomy mountain.
</p>

<p>
It would not be just to so much as hint at a latent insanity in these
men’s minds, for it would partly absolve them from responsibility, and
would dispose their judges to regard their crimes leniently. Certainly no one,
if asked to do so, could have pointed out two keener men of the world than
these. Yet, somehow, despite one’s reluctance to afford them the shadow
of an excuse, there does creep in the conviction that such a ghastly conception
could only be formed in a brain lacking the moral organs, if such an expression
may be used, in a brain unbalanced with natural human sympathy.
</p>

<p>
Marese’s father, old Sternhold, had certainly been mad at one period of
his career. His mother, Lucia, had exhibited a vanity so overweening, and a
temper so intense, that at times it resembled lunacy. It may have been that,
along with the mental powers of calculation and invention which distinguished
old Romy and Sternhold, Marese had also inherited the mental weakness of
Sternhold and Lucia.
</p>

<p>
Theodore had shown a taste for extraordinary studies usually avoided by
healthy-minded men. His father, Aurelian, had passed the whole of his time with
insane patients, and it is said that too much contact with mad people reacts
upon the sane. He had early initiated his son into the mysteries of that sad
science of the mind which deals with its deficiencies. The son’s youth
had been passed in constant intercourse with those harmless and, so to say,
<i>reasonable</i> lunatics who are to be met with in the homes and at the
dinner-tables of medical men, and whose partial sanity and occasional singular
flashes of unnatural intelligence are perhaps more calculated to affect the
minds of others than the vagaries of the downright mad.
</p>

<p>
In one short sentence, this terrible crime, which was looming over Marese and
Theodore, was nothing less than the deliberate intention to destroy the whole
of the claimants to the estate at once. How it originated it is difficult to
imagine, but it did. It might perhaps be partly traced to the injunction in
Aurelian’s papers to take the weapons out of the hands of the companies;
or partly to the oft-expressed wish of Marese’s, after the Roman emperor,
that all the claimants had but one neck, so that he might cut it. The said
emperor has much to answer for.
</p>

<p>
The announced gathering of the claimants at Stirmingham certainly seemed to
bring them all within the reach of the fowler’s net, if he could but cast
it aright. Marese and Theodore had half-formed ideas of blowing the whole
company into the air as they sat at council in the Sternhold Hall on New
Year’s Day, something after the fashion of Guy Fawkes, but with a
deadlier compound than he had at his disposal—nitro-glycerine or
dynamite; especially the first might be trusted to do the work much more
effectually than gunpowder, which was also more difficult to conceal on account
of its bulk.
</p>

<p>
It will barely be believed that these two men, in the height of the nineteenth
century, calmly examined the vault under that famous hall, in order to see if
it was fitted for the purpose. This hall or assembly-room had been finished
about the time that the agitation commenced over the heir to the estate, just
before Sternhold had married, when the Corporation heaped flattery upon him. It
had been named after him.
</p>

<p>
It was a fine room, not too large, and yet of sufficient size to seat an
audience. The object was to afford a concert-room for dramatic and theatrical
performances, and also for balls. As the site was valuable, and every particle
of space had to be utilised in the centre of this mighty city, it had been
built over vaults, which were intended for bonded warehouses; but partly on
account of the high rent asked, and partly because of the dampness of the
cellars—the site was the very centre of the old Swamp—had never
been occupied. The access was bad, and there was no place for a display or
advertisement, which was another reason why the cellars had not let. There was
a certain amount of propriety in holding what was to be called “The Grand
Centennial Family Council” in this hall, built upon the centre of the
ancient Swamp, and named after the founder of the city.
</p>

<p>
Marese and Theodore, in disguise, examined the vaults, under the pretence of
being agents for London merchants desirous of opening business in Stirmingham.
There was hardly any necessity for this precaution, for it was so many years
since they had openly resided in the place that few would have recognised them.
</p>

<p>
To their great surprise, these vaults, whose gloomy darkness they explored by
the light of lanterns, extended in one vast cavern, under the whole of the
hall. Instead of a series of cellars, there was one huge cavern. This was
occasioned by the flooring not being supported upon brick arches, as would have
been architecturally preferable, but upon timber posts, or pillars. The place
had, in fact, been put up hastily, and the vaults were never completed. The
timber pillars were placed in regular order, and it had been intended to build
brick partitions; but as no one seemed to care to occupy the cellars, this had
never been done. The floor was extremely damp, and the whole appearance of the
place repulsive. Snails, toads, and slimy reptiles crawled about, and this
under the very stage above, upon which music, song, and dance were wont to
enliven the gay hearts of the audiences.
</p>

<p>
One great obstacle to the idea of blowing up the place was the height of these
timber posts, which was full eighteen feet, so that the roof of the vault was
high over head, and any explosives, to produce the full effect, would have to
be piled up on casks or stands. Then the hall was larger than they had
supposed, and it was apparent that the coming council would occupy but a
portion of it, and perhaps change that portion now and then, so that it would
be uncertain where to place the nitro-glycerine.
</p>

<p>
The idea, looked at from a distance and in the abstract, seemed feasible
enough; but when they came to face the physical difficulties, it was found to
be hard of realisation. There was the danger of getting the explosives into the
place, the danger of detection, and, finally, the chance of an accident
hoisting the engineer with his own petard, especially at that time of the year
when nitro-glycerine was notoriously dangerous on account of the crystals which
cold formed upon its surface, and the least jar or shake was sufficient to
cause an explosion. Obviously, the plan was a cumbrous one, and without
hesitation it was abandoned.
</p>

<p>
But the main idea, that of getting rid of the claimants at one blow, was not
abandoned; it grew and grew, and occupied their minds day and night. At last
the thought of transferring the Guy Fawkes expedient from the land to the
ocean, which, once the deed was successfully accomplished, would tell no tale,
occurred to them.
</p>

<p>
The claimants must come over on shipboard, if only they could be got into one
or even two ships; and if these vessels sank upon the voyage suddenly without a
warning! This was certainly much safer for the conspirators, as no trace would
be left, and it was surer of success, because in the hall some of the victims
might escape—at sea they could scarcely do so. They ran over in their
minds the various methods of scuttling ships which have been invented from time
to time.
</p>

<p>
There was the good old simple plan of boring holes in the bottom with augurs.
There was the devilish coal-shell. A box painted to resemble coal, but really
containing powder, was thrown among the coal, and when placed in the furnace
blew up the boiler, and destroyed the ship. There was the ship-rat—a
contrivance by which the very motion of the vessel caused an augur in a box to
bore its way through, and so cause a leak. Some benevolent socialists, anxious
for the welfare of man, had also promulgated a notion of exploding
nitro-glycerine by clockwork, arranged to go so long, and set to act just as
the vessel was farthest from land.
</p>

<p>
But all these seemed to Marese and Theodore clumsy, risky, and, what was worse,
uncertain of operation. It was reserved for Marese to suggest the deadliest of
all destructive engines, and he arrived at its conception in this way. He had,
as it were, a double mind. He was liable to flashes of inspiration—such
as it was—to sudden ideas which shot through him without endeavour. He
had also the power of concentrating his thoughts, and bringing the regular
forms of logic to his assistance. But this latter method he could only practise
with the aid of pen and ink; and it was his constant habit, whenever
contemplating an important step, such as a coup upon the Exchange, to write out
his plans in a regular sequence, just as he wished them to take place.
</p>

<p>
This written guide he corrected and enlarged until it seemed beyond any further
improvement; and then shutting his eyes to all consequences, resolutely
avoiding those secret promptings which suggest that something has been left
undone, he was accustomed to rush at the matter in hand, and dispose of it with
bold, unhesitating strokes. This method certainly had its advantages, but it
had also the disadvantage that if by any accident his notes fell into other
hands, he was lost.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, after thinking and thinking in vain over this great problem, and
failing of any very brilliant flash of intelligence, Marese at last resorted to
his favourite system, and sought the solution by the aid of pen and ink. First
he wrote at the top of his rough draft—
</p>

<p>
“What is it that I desire? Define it. Definition: to destroy the
claimants. Who are the claimants? A body of men. How is a body of men to be
destroyed? In the same way as a single person. How is man destroyed? By the
knife, by bullets, by explosives, by garotting, by fire, by water, by poison,
narcotics.”
</p>

<p>
Such were his rough premises. Then he laid the pen down and thought. Why not
set the vessels these men were coming over in on fire? That at first seemed to
him a most feasible plan, far superior to the uncertain action of explosives.
It required some arrangement, which he felt confident the scientific knowledge
of Theodore could easily supply, to cause the flames to break out at the proper
moment.
</p>

<p>
He began to grow enraptured with it. It seemed so easy and sure. Then,
picturing in his mind the vessel sinking, the thought occurred to him that if
the risk was to be run, something might as well be got out of it. Why not put a
cargo on board insured far beyond its value, and so kill two birds with one
stone?
</p>

<p>
At one blow to destroy his enemies and fill his own pockets was superb triumph!
He called Theodore and explained the idea to him. Theodore was struck with
it—especially with the notion of making a profit out of the risk. He was,
however, considerably opposed to the insurance dodge, on the ground that it had
been tried so often, and people had got so keen that it was ten to one if some
suspicion did not arise, especially when it was seen what an object it would be
to Marese to secure the destruction of the passengers. Some other plan must be
adopted. Suppose, for instance, they took Marese’s yacht and followed the
vessel, and after its partial destruction, if they could secure only partial
destruction, put in a claim for salvage. To do this they must encounter serious
difficulties, but it would be far less risky.
</p>

<p>
Marese wished to know what substances they could employ to produce a fire which
could not be extinguished without some special chemical composition. Theodore
produced a series of manuscript volumes containing the notes which he had
accumulated during his long and curious studies. He turned them over one by
one, extracting such information as appeared applicable to their purpose, while
Marese, waiting for his friend’s reply, amused himself by reading pieces
here and there. It was while thus employed that the devilish means by which
their end could be obtained occurred to him.
</p>







<h3>Fourteen.</h3>

<p>
He happened to light on a volume of notes made upon the remarkable properties
of gases. They began with a description of those curious caves and even meadows
abroad wherein no animal can live, and the place is strewn with the bones of
birds and beasts who have incautiously entered the infected circle. This effect
was proved to proceed from a vapour which rose up from the earth, and was no
sooner breathed than it produced asphyxiation. Animals who inhaled it fell as
if shot, so sudden was the action.
</p>

<p>
Gases as deleterious were often generated in wells, caves, and confined places,
such as the huge tuns or casks used by brewers to keep their beer in, and which
had often proved fatal to the men who attempted to scour them out.
</p>

<p>
Theodore believed that the cold shiver which some persons affected to feel upon
entering a churchyard and passing over the graves of the dead, was caused by
the presence of a gas in small quantities, evolved from the decaying remains
beneath the feet. Then there were gases which upon inhalation caused a profound
slumber; others which had precisely an opposite result, and made the patient
lively and brisk; and others which rendered the person who took them perfectly
insensible to surgical operations.
</p>

<p>
Marese, a man who had never paid the least regard to science, was deeply struck
with these facts, with which the veriest tyro in chemistry is well acquainted.
But he did what no tyro or even advanced student would perhaps have
done—he applied his discovery—for so it was to him—to his own
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
There are, says Bacon, three modes of reading—one to pass away an idle
hour, one to acquire a knowledge of a subject, and the third and the most
advantageous method is always to keep your own ends in view, and to apply
everything to your object.
</p>

<p>
In these gases Marese found his desideratum. His engine of destruction burst
upon his mind, as it were, complete in a moment. Some such poisonous gas should
be shipped on board these vessels, closely confined in a box or other
receptacle, and at the proper moment liberated, to spread throughout the
steamer a subtle vapour which no man could see coming, and against which
strength, skill, and discipline would be perfectly powerless.
</p>

<p>
Theodore, looking up, saw a change upon Marese’s countenance, and
immediately knew that something had occurred to him. The heir was pale as
death; his own conception, so ghastly and treacherous, filled him with a
nameless horror at the same moment that he never hesitated in his purpose.
</p>

<p>
After a while he took up a pen and added to his already written premises the
conclusion—his idea in a few brief sentences—and handed it to
Theodore. He left it to Theodore to select the gas, and to arrange the
mechanical details. He had sown the seed, the other must patiently tend it. And
the other did patiently tend it; and this is what it grew to.
</p>

<p>
The name of the gas which Theodore at last, after much thought, fixed upon
shall not be here disclosed; for although it is well-known to chemists, and any
one who can read could easily find it, there is no knowing what imitations
might not spring up if they were aware of the means being so ready at hand.
</p>

<p>
Though suicide is such a simple and obvious expedient in difficulties, yet
there are scores who do not commit it because they never think of it. If some
kind friend suggested the pistol or the knife they would at once employ it.
</p>

<p>
Gas had one property which rendered it peculiarly fitted for the purpose in
view. Being elastic, it could be compressed to a great extent, and thus an
immense volume might be contained in a small compass. Therefore the case or
receptacle to hold the vapour poison need not be of large dimensions; and this
was a matter of some importance.
</p>

<p>
The gas chosen was not in any way explosive; on the contrary, it had the
property of extinguishing any light which was placed in it—there was thus
no danger of any accidental circumstance causing an explosion at an awkward
moment. It was absolutely safe—the operator ran no risk, provided always
that he did not inhale the vapour.
</p>

<p>
Theodore sketched out a case about three feet square, which was to be formed of
an outer box of deal, and an inner skin of thin iron. Into this case, which
would be tolerably strong, he proposed to pump a vast volume of gas, taking
care that the pressure should not exceed the power of the box to withstand. The
aperture through which it had been pumped was then to be hermetically sealed
with molten lead.
</p>

<p>
The greatest difficulty was to provide for the escape of the devilish vapour at
the proper moment; and this caused the projectors much reflection. Clockwork
was objectionable; it was liable to injury from jars and shakes. Cases of this
character, which looked strong and substantial, and would be placed in the
hold, would be certain to receive the roughest of usage.
</p>

<p>
At one time he conceived the idea of relying upon the cupidity of the seamen.
It was suspected that many of the accidents which had taken place at sea, and
caused the destruction of hundreds by fire, had arisen through dishonest seamen
or <i>employés</i> on board going at night with a candle into the
compartment where valuable goods were stowed, and dropping sparks.
</p>

<p>
Why not utilise this propensity? Mark the case “watches,”
“jewellery,” or “bullion,” cause it to be surrounded
with a certain amount of mystery and precaution enough to engender suspicion;
and leave the rest to the chisel and drill of the would-be thief.
</p>

<p>
But this, though clever, was too uncertain. Another idea which occurred to him
was to have a wooden case only, but a strong one, and to confine in a small
hole prepared for the purpose one of the boring insects, which in a certain
time would be sure to eat its way through and leave an aperture.
</p>

<p>
This, too, was more ingenious than practicable. He was delayed for a time.
Accident solved the difficulty. Passing through the streets, he was stopped by
a crowd which had collected around a quack doctor.
</p>

<p>
“See,” cried the vendor of patent vegetable pills, “here is
the horrid stuff the allopathists, the doctors and physicians sell to you at
high prices. Here is a common drug used by them in this phial. I will pour some
of the liquid upon the hard stone pavement—just see how it acts upon the
granite, and then guess how your wretched stomachs must be abused.”
</p>

<p>
He poured it on the stone—the crowd pressed forward, and saw it eat a
hole. “Aquafortis,” thought Theodore, and the idea was
his—aquafortis was the agent he wanted.
</p>

<p>
He passed on, and left the crowd thoroughly convinced of the tricks played by
the medical faculty, and purchasing largely of the vegetable pills. Theodore
had found a substance which would eat through his iron and wood cases, and
leave an aperture—a substance, too, whose action was equal, and could be
regulated to a sufficiently accurate extent.
</p>

<p>
Upon reflection, however, and after making several experiments, he did not
employ ordinary aquafortis, but another acid equally powerful, and which was
still more regular in its action. He tried the experiment time after time, till
at last he obtained the proper strength, and fixed the requisite amount of acid
to eat through a given thickness of iron and wood in a certain time. He
repeated the experiment till he was absolutely certain of the result.
</p>

<p>
The plan had now grown delightfully clear and well-defined—the infernal
machine became of the simplest construction. All that had to be done was to
place the acid in the case confined in a small and very thin copper vessel
(lined with an enamel to resist it), which was to be screwed to one side of the
case, then pump the gas in, hermetically seal it, heave the whole thing on
board the steamer, and leave it to work its way. Delightfully simple!
</p>

<p>
He called Marese to look over his drawings, and to witness his experiments with
the acid. Marese was enchanted; his confidence in Theodore’s scientific
resources was confirmed. There was, however, one question he asked—Was
the gas so strong and so poisonous that the small quantity confined in a case
three feet square would destroy a whole ship’s company? Would not the gas
escape, rise up, and dissipate itself through the port-holes, up the hatchways,
and be further weakened by the breezes that blew and caused draught in various
places between decks? These ocean steamers were very roomy.
</p>

<p>
Theodore was delighted to have an opportunity of explaining the properties and
nature of the vapour to his friend. The peculiarity of this gas was that,
although an invisible fluid, it was extremely heavy—it was heavier far
than atmospheric air. He easily proved that a gas might be heavier than air by
a well-known experiment with a vapour (not the one to be used in this case)
which he poured out of a glass phial over a candle. The invisible gas descended
and extinguished the candle; There was not the slightest chance of the
poison-vapour escaping quickly through ports or up hatchways. It would, as it
were, cling to the vessel. The pressure inside the case would cause it to issue
rapidly from the aperture eaten out by the acid. It would then diffuse itself
laterally, and gradually penetrate into every crevice and corner of the ship.
The effect would be that one by one every person on board would inhale it, and
in an instant, let the quantity breathed be never so small, down he would drop,
or grow rigid as he sat—unconscious was the word Theodore used as an
euphemism for death. He did not mention another effect it would have, lest the
horror of it should cause even Marese to falter.
</p>

<p>
Theodore traced out the probable course of events on board the fated vessel.
First, the persons working or living in the cabins and places nearest the case
would feel the effect and succumb. Then there would be alarm and
excitement—others would rush to the spot, and they would immediately
fall, just as the birds and beast did who entered those fatal caves abroad. One
man on board, perhaps, might detect the cause—the surgeon, or any doctor
who chanced to be a passenger—and might cry out to man the boats and
escape; but who, in the hurry and excitement, would heed him?—he would
not have time to escape himself, much less to explain the danger to others. It
was doubtful whether even so much as a signal of distress would be hoisted. The
crew, the officers, the passengers would be so completely puzzled, so utterly
at their wit’s end, that no course would suggest itself to them before it
was too late.
</p>

<p>
In this respect the gas had an immense advantage over any apparatus which would
set the ship on fire. Let the fire be never so rapid, one boat at least might
get away, and on that boat the very person whom it was most desirable should
seek the floor of the ocean. Moreover, fire could be seen from a vast distance,
and might attract attention from other vessels, who by day would observe the
smoke, and by night the glare of the flames.
</p>

<p>
But in this case probably not so much as a flag would be hoisted. One by one
the seamen and passengers, the captain and officers, would succumb to the
invisible vapour, first becoming weak and helpless, and next
“unconscious.” The steersman would fall at the wheel. The engineer
would drop at his engine; the stoker as he shovelled up the coal; the passenger
would lie in his berth. And the steamer, so long as the fuel in the furnace
lasted, would pursue her way unguided over the waves; finally, after a few
hours, to float a derelict at the mercy of the wind.
</p>

<p>
There was a completeness, a finish, an elaboration of detail about this scheme
which fascinated the conspirators. It was so novel, daring, and yet safe, it
enchanted them. When at last the great horror was discovered, what risk would
there be? Nothing on board would excite suspicion. The gas had actually no
smell; besides, long before anything was discovered, it would have dissipated
itself.
</p>

<p>
Even if the whole of the cargo was examined, the case itself would offer, no
handle to an inquirer. The powerful acid would have eaten its way out, and
nothing would be left but a small empty case with a hole in it. Nothing need
show who consigned the case. Better still: Marese’s yacht would follow
the doomed steamer, keeping close on pretence of the safety of having company
in a voyage across the Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
They would easily know when the desired result was obtained by the view of the
steamer rolling helplessly in the trough of the waves. By the time that was the
case some hours would have elapsed after the catastrophe, and various pretences
could be arranged to avoid immediately proceeding on board—especially as
from a distance nothing would look the matter—and by then the poisonous
vapour would have dissipated itself, or so mixed with the air as to have lost
its fatal power. They would then take charge of the vessel and bring it into
port, and claim the salvage.
</p>

<p>
If they contrived to select a vessel which carried a valuable cargo, that
salvage money would be something extremely large in amount, added to the value
of the steamer itself. They might manoeuvre to get such a cargo stored. This
would be far superior to the clumsy dodge of sinking the ship and claiming the
insurance money.
</p>

<p>
As to getting the case on board, it was as easy as could be. Having proceeded
to New York in Marese’s yacht, taking with them the necessary apparatus
for producing the gas (which was very simple), and pumping it into the case,
they could ascertain the hour of the steamer’s departure, fill the case,
regulate the acid for say four, or perhaps three days, and send it on board
only a little while before she started. They would then, on board the yacht,
proceed to sea on a cruise and keep the steamer in sight.
</p>

<p>
Delightfully simple! Perfectly complete and scientific in every detail!
</p>

<p>
Marese once again asked if the gas was really so powerful? Theodore referred to
his note-books, and showed him an extract from a newspaper not of so very
remote a date, wherein it was stated that at a conference of the various
leading European Powers it had been resolved not to employ certain implements
in warfare, such as explosive shells or bullets under a certain size, and
poisonous gases or vapours which could be thrown into a fortress or town in
shells. Marese was convinced, and regarded the engine as perfect.
</p>

<p>
Thus did two men deliberately plan out the destruction of several hundreds of
their fellow-beings without one single thought or reflection upon the misery
and suffering they would cause, or upon the intrinsic villainy of the act.
</p>

<p>
Well was it suggested by a French thinker that certain natures are incapable of
feeling, incapable of remorse so long as they remain “faithful to the
logic of their type”—i.e. faithful to their own selfish interests
and passions.
</p>







<h3>Fifteen.</h3>

<p>
With his own hands Theodore constructed the infernal machine and prepared the
materials for generating the deadly vapour at the shortest notice. This, the
first part of the scheme, having been settled, there remained two great
difficulties to overcome. The first was to get the claimants on board one
vessel—travelling in a body; and the second was to secure their passage
by a steamer carrying a valuable cargo, so as to increase the gain of salvage
money to the utmost.
</p>

<p>
It was not easy to manage the first matter; the latter Marese thought he saw
his way through. It happened just then that the payment of the war indemnity to
Germany caused a great drain of gold from this country; the value of the
precious metals consequently rose, and the imports increased to meet the
demand. Gold and silver came in large quantities from New York, both in coin
and bullion—especially silver.
</p>

<p>
Marese intended to take advantage of this fact. By means of certain Stock
Exchange operations, with which he was perfectly familiar, having employed them
previously on several occasions, he arranged that a very large amount of
bullion should be transmitted to London from New York by the splendid steamer
<i>Lucca</i>, due to start on December 3rd.
</p>

<p>
It must be understood that this bullion was not to be despatched to Marese, and
that he did not appear in the transaction as having any direct connection with
it. He had, in fact, arranged to lose a small sum of money, in order to render
the importation of bullion particularly profitable in the week ending December
17th—profitable not to him, but to those speculators who deal in precious
metal just as others do in corn or calico. Marese omitted no precaution, Spared
no pains, and used the whole of his natural and acquired cunning to render this
operation a certainty.
</p>

<p>
The next thing was to tempt the claimants to travel by the steamer
<i>Lucca</i>. After considerable hesitation, Marese at last determined to open
negotiations with the leading men amongst them. He did not do this in his own
person, but through his solicitors. It was represented to the managers of the
Baskette and Sibbold Lodges that really their claims and the interests of the
heir—i.e. Marese—were not so divergent as had been supposed. The
heir was quite as much excluded from the enjoyment of the property as they
were, and finding the building societies determined, by every means in their
power, to put off the day when they must yield up possession, he wished to make
common cause against these companies.
</p>

<p>
Nor was this statement altogether fictitious. The idea of strengthening the
hands of the claimants, and making common cause with them, had often occurred
to Marese, for the sole purpose of taking the weapons of the companies out of
their hands, as Aurelian had advised.
</p>

<p>
No sooner was this overture on the part of the heir received in America than
both Lodges at once responded, and without a moment’s hesitation fell
into the snare laid for them. To us, who are acquainted with the infamous
designs of Marese, such conduct seems almost senile; but it must be remembered
that these men on the other side of the Atlantic had not the slightest
suspicion of the deadly engine which had been preparing.
</p>

<p>
To some extent the sudden overture of the heir caused a cessation of
hostilities between the two Lodges, and when Marese’s second offer
arrived they held a species of jubilee. This offer was nothing less than to
convey the whole of the claimants at his own expense, and added that he had
already notified to the owners of the <i>Lucca</i> that he might require the
entire passage accommodation, or nearly, of that vessel. To the Americans this
came as an immense boon. There were many of them comparatively poor men, to
whom the cost of the voyage was a serious matter, and who had already begun to
hesitate at the prospect before them.
</p>

<p>
The diabolical foresight of Marese and Theodore had guessed as much. They said
to each other, “Half the claimants will not come—only those who are
tolerably well off. Then what will be the use of our scheme? We shall destroy
only a few, and from the remaining individuals a new crop will spring up to vex
us. We must get them all—all!”
</p>

<p>
This offer was accepted with a <i>fanfaronnade</i> of gratitude. It had one
inestimable advantage—it secured the passage of the claimants by the
vessel Marese had chosen. The enthusiasm on the other side of the Atlantic was
raised to its highest pitch when the heir announced his intention of coming to
New York in his yacht, to see that the arrangements, for his friends were
properly carried out.
</p>

<p>
Preparations were at once made to give him an ovation. The authorities of New
York city gave orders to do him honour. The papers published biographies of
“this distinguished man, upon whom the eyes of all the world were
fixed,” and who had lately “covered himself with glory by
displaying a grand generosity towards the offshoots of the parent stem.”
</p>

<p>
It often happens that in America the descendants of particular families are
gathered in and around certain districts, where they form the main part of the
population. This was the case with the Baskettes and Sibbolds. The Baskettes
chiefly inhabited Caben, a small township west of Philadelphia, and the
Sibbolds were mostly to be found at Tandanap, near the shores of Lake Michigan.
Numbers of both tribes of course were scattered over the whole country, but
these were the strongholds. To suit both parties, and to tend to remove the
jealousies which had so long raged, it was arranged that all should meet at
Imola, a place about midway and within a hundred and twenty miles of New York,
about a week previous to the embarkation.
</p>

<p>
At Imola (named after a Continental town) there resided perhaps the wealthiest
member of the Baskette and Sibbold tribes, for he could claim relationship with
both—he offered hospitality to them all; and in return it was agreed that
this Reginald Bunker Sibbold Baskette, Esq, should be instituted the leader or
president of the expedition. After the mobilisation of the forces at Imola, the
army was to move on New York on the 2nd December, and embark the same evening
on board the <i>Lucca</i> steamship.
</p>

<p>
The whole scheme was now complete, and extremely promising it looked;
everything had turned out well. Marese had ascertained by secret inquiries that
the bullion had been ordered, and that the owners of the <i>Lucca</i> had
contracted, under a heavy bond, to deliver it at a certain date. The Lodges
had, for a time at least, fused their differences. The engine of destruction
was finished, together with a duplicate in case of accident. How extremely
simple it looked! Nothing in the world but a strong deal box, apparently nailed
together in the usual manner, about a yard square, or a little less. Just such
a box as a seaman or passenger, if it chanced to lie about, would choose to sit
down on and smoke a pipe. The rough deal planks of which it was made were not
even planed smooth—simply a strong packing-case. The conspirators
congratulated themselves upon the approaching execution of their schemes, and
the success which seemed certain to attend them.
</p>

<p>
But now Theodore discovered a serious oversight. Reading through
Aurelian’s papers a second time, he came upon that passage which detailed
all that could be learnt of the descendants of Arthur Sibbold. This Arthur,
Aurelian wrote, or his descendants, was the most dangerous of all. He was the
man who ought to have succeeded to the farm which James Sibbold took possession
of. James, or James’s sons, had not the slightest right to dispose of the
farm to Sternhold Baskette; they were selling what did not belong to them.
Arthur was of course dead, but Arthur’s heirs still lived; and then
followed the address and further particulars.
</p>

<p>
These heirs were at present quiet; but if they discovered the register of
Arthur’s marriage, Aurelian could not see what was to prevent them from
putting in a claim far superior either to Marese’s or to that of any
other person. Even if they could not get possession, the Courts would certainly
order an immense sum to be paid to them, as compensation; and Aurelian thought
himself that nothing in the world could prevent them taking the property which
stood on the site of the farm, if not the Swamp. The property on the site of
the farm, he thought, must go.
</p>

<p>
“Now,” said Theodore, “what is the use of destroying the
American claimants <i>en masse</i> if this even greater danger is to be allowed
to remain close at home, within easy reach of the estate, ready at any moment
to burst upon us and render nugatory all our risk and labour?”
</p>

<p>
Marese was thunderstruck. For a time it seemed that their enemies were
hydra-headed—no sooner was one head cut off than three sprouted up in the
place. But the man was not one to be daunted. This also must be done, he said.
They had not much time now to lose. It was already the middle of September, and
a fortnight must be reckoned for the passage of the yacht to New York. They
spent anxious days and nights considering a variety of plans. There is not time
to unravel the strange mazes of the mind and trace the genesis of the idea
which at last suggested itself to Theodore. It was only one degree less
ingenious, and if anything still more horrible, than the infernal machine of
Marese.
</p>

<p>
Theodore still continued the asylum at Stirmingham. It was an important source
of income, in fact. In that asylum there were confined lunatics of all degrees
of insanity, most of them having wealthy friends, and some the representatives
of large properties. Among these was one more remarkable than the rest. He was
the representative of a long line of lunatics, or semi-lunatics. Popular
tradition accused a progenitor living two centuries before of a crime too dark
to be mentioned, and believed that the lunacy of his descendants was a special
punishment from heaven. This particular individual had seemed tolerably sane
till he was permitted to marry—a cruel thing. He then rapidly developed
his inherited tendencies, living as a married man, left more free from
restraint by friends and others.
</p>

<p>
Though the owner of broad acres and lovely woodlands, he delighted in the
society of tinkers, and was himself a clever hand at mending pots and kettles.
He had such a fancy for tinkering that he actually promenaded the country for
miles in company with gipsies, calling at the farmhouses—on his own
tenants—asking for things to mend.
</p>

<p>
He was also absurdly fond of dogs, and filled the house with
them—especially the large mastiff breed, of which he was particularly
enraptured, till no one could approach it, and his poor wife was frightened out
of her senses. Tinkering, fondling these dogs, and playing the tin whistle
occupied his time. His money he scattered far and wide among the gipsies,
pedlars, and tinkers, and gave enormous sums for the pure-bred mastiffs.
</p>

<p>
The countenance of the man expressed the most intense melancholy—that
hopeless incurable vacancy of look which is seen on the features of some
monkeys while in captivity. His face, and the shape of his head, in fact, much
resembled a monkey’s; and the ears protruding from the side of the skull,
very large and ill-formed, completed the resemblance. He had a favourite resort
in one of the woods surrounding the family mansion. Through this wood there ran
a stream, and a tree had fallen across it, making a natural bridge.
</p>

<p>
On this tree, over the stream, he would perch himself astride, his feet nearly
in the water, and play for hours upon the tin whistle, while his troop of dogs
disported in the woods around. He had a wonderful instinct of music, and really
played in a marvellous manner upon this simple instrument, exhibiting skill
even in the choice of the whistle—for it is difficult to find one that
has a mellow tone.
</p>

<p>
The spectacle of this being, sitting on the tree trunk in the gloom of the
woods, his long legs dangling down to the water, with his melancholy baboon
face, performing extraordinary fantasias upon a tin whistle, could hardly be
matched.
</p>

<p>
But he was as cunning as he was mad. Probably from his companions, the gipsies,
he had learnt that his ancestors had all been confined in the madhouse. He had
sufficient sense to foresee that the moment a son was born to his wife he would
himself be confined. But, with the inherent insanity of his nature, he thought
that by killing the wife or the son he should escape this danger.
</p>

<p>
So soon as ever the wretched wife’s confinement approached he slew
her—and slew her in true fantastic fashion. With his tinker’s
hammer he drove a nail into her head as she slept. He fled from the place, but
was captured; and that was the last time Odo Lechester used his tinker’s
hammer for some time to come. The dreadful deed, the sight of blood, had
developed in him the homicidal tendency—he tried hard to stab his
captors. In Aurelian’s asylum at Stirmingham he desperately wounded a
warder.
</p>

<p>
This was the being Theodore selected for his purpose. The man had made many
violent attempts to escape—he was like a wild beast in a cage, pacing to
and fro.
</p>

<p>
Theodore went down to Stirmingham to his private residence, which adjoined the
asylum, to prepare his tool for the deed. It was easy for him, as a physician
and the owner of the establishment, to have full and private access to Odo
Lechester. He had a fortnight for his task. In that time he succeeded in
impressing upon Odo’s mind that the persons whose name and address he
gave him were those who were responsible for his confinement.
</p>

<p>
It was not his (Theodore’s) fault that he was confined—it was the
fault of these persons, and upon them the punishment should fall. The man
imbibed the idea thoroughly: he brooded over revenge if ever he should get
free. His one-sided mind became absorbed in two great overmastering
passions—to revenge his captivity, and to recover his favourite dogs.
</p>

<p>
Theodore assured him that if ever these persons were out of the way he would be
at once reinstalled in his position, and might wander at his sweet will,
tinkering and playing his whistle.
</p>

<p>
Theodore’s plan was to let this irresponsible murderer out at large upon
the world. The obnoxious persons would be removed, and no one could be
punished. He arranged for the escape of Odo Lechester at about the date he and
Marese would start for New York.

<p>
Their plans were now complete. Theodore, in order to obtain the lunatic’s
goodwill, had restored to him his whistle; and he roamed to and fro in the
court of the asylum, examining the high walls, stone by stone, for a crevice of
escape, while his rapid fingers manipulated interminable airs of the merriest
kind.
</p>



<p>
When the engineer approached the ancient Swamp with his level and theodolite,
and was followed by an army of workmen in short corduroys and slops, who
cleared away the rushes and bull-polls, swept off the willow-beds and
watercress, drove the waterfowl away and plucked up the reeds and sedges, then
the water-rat knew that his time was come. The teeth that had nibbled away at
the willow-tree root till it fell and blocked up the stream, would nibble no
more. The nimble feet and black eyes would be seen no more biding among the
flags, or plunging out of sight into the water as a footstep was heard.
</p>

<p>
The lake which the water-rat had made, with its islands and its cotters, was in
its way useful, and not altogether despicable. The poor basket-makers, humble
as they were, made good and useful baskets, mended pots and pans, split good
clothes-pegs, and injured no man till Sibbold fired that fatal shot.
</p>

<p>
From that hour a curse seemed to hang over the place. A vast city, full of
seething human life, had taken the place of the swamp and the bullrushes; the
hearths of the poor cotters were gone, and huge hotels, club-houses, theatres,
were there instead. Progress and development—yes; but with development
came crime.
</p>

<p>
Under that overgrown city there extended a system of tunnels, sewers—some
large enough to drive a horse and cart down them, others hardly large enough to
admit the band. But they extended everywhere. Under the busy street, under the
quiet office where the only sound was the scratching of the pen, or the buzz of
a fly “in th’ pane;” under the gay theatre and the gossiping
club-house there was not a spot that was not undermined.
</p>

<p>
And in these subterranean catacombs there dwelt a race nearly as numerous as
the human hive above, who worked and gnawed in the dark; they were the domains
of the successors of the little furred creatures which nibbled down the ancient
willow tree. The grey sewer-rat worked and multiplied exceedingly beneath this
mighty city. The grey rat was worse than the water-rat.
</p>

<p>
He had his human prototypes. What were Marese and Theodore but sewer-rats
working in secret, in the dark underground, out of sight, whose presence could
hardly be detected by a faint occasional scratching or rustle?
</p>

<p>
Beside these there were a numerous company of lesser men and masculine brutes,
and female fiends, burrowing, fighting in the dark places of this mighty city,
whose presence was made known at times by faint sounds of shrieking or devilish
glee which rose up, as it were, from the bowels of the earth. The reign of the
harmless water-rat was over. The rule of the sewer-rat was now in full force.
