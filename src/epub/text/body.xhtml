<h2>Book I. Facts.</h2>

<h3>One.</h3>

<p>
It is not generally known that the mighty city of Stirmingham owes its
existence to a water-rat. Stirmingham has a population of half a million, and
is the workshop of the earth. It is a proud city, and its press-men have traced
its origin back into the dim vista of the past, far before Alfred the
Great’s time, somewhere in the days of those monarchs who came from Troy,
and whose deeds Holinshed so minutely chronicles.
</p>

<p>
But this is all trash and nonsense, and is a cunning device of the able editors
aforesaid, who confound—for their own purposes—the city proper with
the tiny hamlet of Wolf’s Glow. This little village or cluster of houses,
which now forms a part, and the dirtiest part, of the city, can indeed be
traced through Hundred Rolls, Domesday Book, and Saxon Charters, almost down to
the time of the Romans. But Stirmingham, the prosperous and proud Stirmingham,
which thinks that the world could not exist without its watches and guns, its
plated goods, its monster factories and mills, which sends cargoes to
Timbuctoo, and supplies Java and Malabar with idols—this vast place,
whose nickname is a by-word for cheating, for fair outward show and no real
solidity, owes its existence to a water-rat. This is a fact. And it happened in
this way.
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time there was a wide expanse of utterly useless land, flat as this
sheet of paper, without a trace of subsoil or any kind of earth in which so
much as a blade of grass could grow. It was utterly dry and sterile—not a
tree nor a shrub to shelter a cow or a horse, and all men avoided it as a waste
and desolate place. It was the very abomination of desolation, and no one would
have been surprised to have seen satyrs and other strange creatures diverting
themselves thereon. Around one edge of this plain there flowed a brook, so
small that one could hardly call it by that name. A dainty lady from Belgravia
could have easily stepped across it without soiling the sole of her boot.
</p>

<p>
At one spot beside this brook there grew a willow tree. This tree was a picture
in itself, and would have made the fortune of any artist who would have
condescended to make a loving study of it. The trunk had been of very large
size, but now resembled a canoe standing upon end, for nearly one half had
decayed, and the crumbling wood had disappeared, leaving a hollow stem. The
stem was itself dead and decaying, except one thin streak of green, up which
the golden sap of life still ran, and invigorated the ancient head of the tree
to send forth yellow buds and pointed leaves. Up one side of the hollow trunk
an ivy creeper had climbed to the top, and was fast hanging festoons from bough
to bough.
</p>

<p>
In the vast mass of decaying wood at the top or head of the tree a briar had
taken root—its seed no doubt dropped by some thrush—and its prickly
shoots hung over and drooped to the ground in luxuriance of growth. The hardy
fern had also found a lodging here, and its dull green leaves, which they say
grow most by moonlight, formed a species of crown to the dying tree.
</p>

<p>
This willow was the paradise of such birds as live upon insects, for they
abounded in the decaying wood; and at the top a wild pigeon had built its nest.
As years went by, the willow bent more and more over the brook. The water
washing the soil out from between its roots formed a hollow space, where a
slight eddy scooped out a deeper hole, in which the vermillion—throated
stickleback or minnow disported and watched the mouth of its nest. This eddy
also weakened the tree by undermining it at its foundation. The ivy grew
thicker till it formed a perfect bush upon the top, and this in the winter
afforded a hold for the wind to shake the tree by. The wind would have passed
harmlessly through the slender branches, but the ivy, even in winter, the
season of storms, left something against which it could rage with effect.
Finally came the water-rat.
</p>

<p>
If Stirmingham objects to owe its origin to a water-rat, it may at least
congratulate itself upon the fact that it was a good old English rat—none
of your modern parvenu, grey Hanoverian rascals. It was, in fact, before the
Norwegian rat, which had been imported in the holds of vessels, had obtained
undisputed sway over the country. It had, however, already driven the darker
aboriginal inhabitants away from the cultivated places to take refuge in the
woods and streams. It is odd that in the animal kingdom also, even in the rat
economy, the darker hued race should give way to the lighter. However, as in
Stirmingham the smoke is so great that the ladies when they walk abroad carry
parasols up to keep the blacks from falling on and disfiguring their
complexion, there can after all be no disgrace in the water-rat ancestry.
</p>

<p>
This dark coloured water-rat, finding his position less and less secure at the
adjacent barn on account of the attacks of the grey invaders, one fine day
migrated, with Mrs Rat and all the Master and Missy rats, down to the stream.
Peeping and sniffing about for a pleasant retreat, he chose the neighbourhood
of the willow tree. I cannot stay here to discuss whether or no he was led to
the tree by some mystic beckoning hand—some supernatural presentiment;
but to the tree he went, and Stirmingham was founded. Two or three
burrows—small round holes—sufficed to house Mr Rat and his family,
but these ran right under the willow, and of course still further weakened it.
</p>

<p>
In course of time the family flourished exceedingly, and Mr Rat became a
great-great-great-grandpapa to ever so many minor Frisky Tails. These Frisky
Tails finding the ancient quarter too much straightened for comfort, began to
scratch further tunnels, and succeeded pretty well in opening additional
honeycombs, till presently progress was stayed by a root of the tree. Now they
had gnawed through and scratched away half a dozen other roots, and never
paused to sniff more particularly at this than the others. But it so happened
that this root was the one which supplied the green streak up the trunk of the
tree with the golden sap of life drawn by mysterious chemical processes from
the earth. Frisky Tails gnawed this root asunder, and cut off the supply of
sap. The green streak up the trunk withered and died, and the last stay of the
willow was gone. It only remained for the first savage south-wester of winter
to finish the mischief.
</p>

<p>
The south-wester came, and over went the trunk, crash across the brook. At
first this was very awkward for the rats, as thereby most of their subterranean
dwellings became torn up and exposed. But very soon a geological change
occurred.
</p>

<p>
The tree had fallen obliquely across the stream, and its ponderous head, or
top, choked up the bed, or very nearly. The sand and small sticks, leaves, and
so on, brought down by the current, filled up the crevices left by the tree,
and a perfect dam was formed.
</p>

<p>
Now, as stated before, the ground thereabout was nearly level, and so worthless
in character that no man ever troubled his head about it. No one came to see
the dam or remove it. The result was the brook overflowed, and then finding
this level plateau, instead of eating out a new channel, it spread abroad, and
formed first a good-sized puddle, then a pond, then something like a flood,
and, as time went by, a marsh. This marsh extended over a space of ground fully
a mile long, and altogether covered some nine hundred acres.
</p>

<p>
The rats, sagacious creatures, instead of deserting their colony, showed that
they possessed that species of wisdom which the Greek sage said was superior to
all other knowledge—namely, the knowledge how to turn an evil to a good.
Exploring this shallow lake which their carelessness had caused, they found
several places still unsubmerged—islands, in fact. To one of these they
swam, dug out new catacombs, and being now quite safe from interruption, and
protected upon all sides, the Malthusian laws of population had full play, and
soon proved its force, for the whole place swarmed with them. The axiom,
however, that at the very point when empires are apparently most prosperous,
their destruction is near at hand, to some extent applied even to the dominion
of the water-rat. They were no longer to be the sole undisturbed possessors.
</p>

<p>
Arguing <i>à priori</i>, one would have concluded that if this waste
land was worthless before, now it was a marsh, and miasmatic vapours arose from
it, it would be still more avoided. But the facts were exactly opposite. So
soon as ever the water had spread over the level plain, and had well soaked
into the sterile soil, there began to spring up tough aquatic grasses, commonly
called bull-polls, from a supposed resemblance between their tangled appearance
and the rough hair that hangs over the poll of a bull.
</p>

<p>
These grasses are gregarious—that is to say, they prefer to grow in huge
bunches. Each bunch increasing year after year, forms in time a small hillock
or tuft, and, the roots spreading and spreading, these hillocks of grass almost
covered the lake, leaving only narrow channels of water between. Upon these
innumerable frogs and toads crawled up out of the water, and they were the
chosen resorts of newts.
</p>

<p>
In summer time the blue dragon-fly wheeled in mazes over them, or, while
settled on the stiff blades of grass, looked like a species of blossom. The
current of the brook brought down seeds, and soon the tall reed began to rear
its slender stem, and rustle its feathery head in the breeze. The sedges came
also, and fringed the marsh with a border of green.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, the root which the rats had gnawed asunder beneath the ancient willow
tree, felt the power of spring, and made one more effort. Freed from the
incubus of the dead trunk, it threw out a shoot of its own. From this shoot
there proceeded other shoots; and, in short, after a while the islands in the
marsh became covered with willow trees and osier-beds. The reeds grew apace,
and by the time the islands were clothed with willow, the rest of the marsh was
occupied by them, saving only the fringe of sedge, and the almost immortal
bull-polls, which were as tough as leather, and which nothing could kill.
</p>

<p>
Now, also, animal life began to people the once-deserted waste. With the sedges
came the sedge-warblers; with the willows came the brook-sparrows; and above
all, came the wild-fowl. The heron stalked to and fro between the bull-polls;
the ducks swam in and out; the moor-hens took up their residence; and in winter
the widgeons and snipes visited the place in myriads.
</p>

<p>
It was now time for man. And man came. He came first in the person of here and
there a cotter, who cut himself a huge bundle of reeds for fuel, to mend his
thatch, or litter his pig; then in the person of the poacher—if it could
be called poaching to hunt where no one preserved—who, with
long-barrelled gun, brass-fitted and flint-locked, brought down half a dozen
ducks at once, and then waded in after them.
</p>

<p>
One day a travelling gipsy tribe came by, and encamped for the night close to
the marsh. In this tribe there was a man who, in his way, possessed the genius
of Alexander the Great. Alexander chancing to pass a landlocked harbour utterly
neglected, saw at a glance its capabilities, and built a city which is renowned
to this day.
</p>

<p>
This gipsy fellow, who was only a gipsy by marriage, saw this unoccupied marsh,
with its wild-fowl, its fish, and, above all, its willows, and at once fixed
upon it as a promising spot.
</p>

<p>
He was a basket-maker by trade.
</p>

<p>
He waded in to one of the islets, carrying his infant in his arms, and followed
by his wife, who carried his tools. He set up his tent-pole, and in time
superseded it with a cottage of sod, roofed with reeds. All day he made baskets
of willow and flags, in the evening he shot ducks and widgeon. The baskets he
sold in the towns, the ducks he ate. One or two others followed his example.
</p>

<p>
The gipsy tribe made it a rule to come that way twice a year to purchase the
baskets and retail them all over the country. The original settlers had sons,
and the sons took possession of other islets, built sod cottages, of
wattle-and-daub, and married wives, till there were ten or twelve settlements
upon the islands; and these ten or twelve, all in a rude sort of way, gave the
chieftainship to the original basket-maker, whose name happened to be Baskette.
</p>

<p>
These people, in the heart of a midland county, lived almost exactly the life
that was led at the same period by the dwellers in the fen countries to the
eastward. It was a rude existence, but it was free and independent, and not
without a charm to those who had been born and bred in it. Even this unenviable
life was, however, to be disturbed. Two mighty giants were preparing, like the
ogres in the fairy tales, to eat up the defenceless population. The lid of a
certain tea-kettle had puffed up and down, and Steam had been born. The other
ogre was called Legal Rights, and began to bite first.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Two.</h3>

<p>
So long as this waste land was tenanted only by the “owl and the
bittern,” Legal Rights slumbered. The moment man put his foot upon it the
ogre woke up, for it is not permitted to that miserable two-legged creature to
rest in peace anywhere in this realm.
</p>

<p>
The village of Wolf’s Glow was distant about a mile and a quarter from
the old willow tree whose fall had dammed up the brook and caused the marsh.
The brook, in fact, ran past the village, and supplied more than one farmhouse
with water. These farms were of the poorest class—mere stretches of
pasture-land, and such pasture which a well-fed donkey would despise!
</p>

<p>
The poorest farm, in appearance at all events, was Wick—a large but
tumbledown place, roofed with grey slates, which, stood apart from the village.
It was the largest house in the place, and yet seemed the most
poverty-stricken. The grey slates were falling off. The roof-tree had cracked
and bent, the lattice windows were broken, and the holes stuffed up with
bundles of hay and straw. The garden was choked with weeds, and the very apple
trees in the orchard were withering away.
</p>

<p>
Old Sibbold, the owner and occupier, was detested by the entire village, and by
no one more than his two sons. He was a miser, and yet nothing seemed to
prosper with him; and pare and save as much as he would he could make no
accumulation. His sons were the only labourers he employed, though his farm was
the largest thereabouts, and he paid them only in lodging and food, and not
much of the latter.
</p>

<p>
The eldest, Arthur, chafed bitterly under this treatment, for he appears, from
the scanty records that remain of him, to have been a lad of spirit and energy.
</p>

<p>
The second son, James, was of a grosser nature, and his mind was chiefly
occupied with eating and drinking. He had an implicit faith in the wealth of
his father, and submitted patiently to all these hardships and rough treatment
in the hope of ingratiating himself with the old man, and perhaps supplanting
Arthur in his will—that is, so far as his money was concerned, for the
land, as the villagers said, “went by heirship”—i.e. was
entailed—but who would care for such land?
</p>

<p>
Arthur saw the game and did nothing to prevent it; on the contrary, he took a
certain pleasure in irritating the savage and morose old man, whom he
thoroughly despised. Perhaps what happened in the future was a punishment for
this unfilial conduct, however much it was provoked.
</p>

<p>
The mother, it must be understood, had long been dead, and there was no
mediator between the stern old man and his fiery-tempered son. Old Sibbold was
descended of a good family—one that had once held a position, not only in
the county but in the country—and he dwelt much on the past, recalling
the time when a Sibbold had held a bishop a prisoner for King John.
</p>

<p>
He pored over the deeds in his old oak chest—a press, which stood on four
carved legs, and was closed with a ponderous padlock. That chest, if it could
be found now, would be worth its weight, not in gold merely, but in diamonds.
At that time these deeds and parchments were of little value; they related
mostly to by-gone days, and Arthur ridiculed his father’s patient study
of their crabbed handwriting.
</p>

<p>
What was the use of dwelling on the past?—up and speculate on the
present!
</p>

<p>
Irritated beyond measure, old Sibbold would reply that half the county belonged
to him, and he could prove it. All that they could see from that window was
his.
</p>

<p>
“Why,” said Arthur, “all we can see is the Lea, which is as
barren as the crown of my hat, except in weeds and bulrushes!”
</p>

<p>
“Barren or not, they’re mine,” said Sibbold, closing his
chest; “and I will make those squatters pay!”
</p>

<p>
For the Lea was that piece of waste ground which the brook had overflowed, and
in a sense rendered fertile.
</p>

<p>
From that hour began a persecution of the basket-makers who had settled on the
little islets in the marsh. Sibbold had an undoubted parchment
right—whether he had a moral and true right to a place he had never
touched with spade or plough is a different matter. He claimed a rent. The
cotters refused to pay. Their chieftain, old Will Baskette, wanted to
compromise matters, and offered a small quit-rent.
</p>

<p>
Now every one knows that quit-rent and rent are very different things in a
legal point of view. A man who pays rent can be served with notice to quit. A
man who pays quit-rent has a claim upon the soil, and cannot be ejected.
Sibbold refused the quit-rent, and had the squatters served with a notice. They
went on cutting reeds, weaving baskets, and shooting wild-fowl, just the same;
till one day old Sibbold, accompanied with a posse of constables (there were no
police in those days), walked into the marsh with his jack-boots on; and, while
one of the cotters was absent selling his baskets, began to tear the little hut
down, despite the curses of the women and the wailing of the children. But the
hut, as it happened, was stronger in reality than appearance, and resisted the
attack, till one of the constables suggested fire.
</p>

<p>
A burning brand from the cottage hearth was applied by old Sibbold himself to
the reed thatch, and in a moment up shot a fierce blaze which left nothing but
ashes, and sod walls two feet high. One can imagine the temper a man of gipsy
blood would be in when, on returning home, he found his children crying and the
women silent, sitting among the ruins. From that hour a spirit of revenge took
possession of the dwellers in this Dismal Swamp of hostility to the village.
</p>

<p>
Hitherto these half savage people had paid of their own free will a kind of
tribute to the regular house-folk of Wolf’s Glow. The farmers’
wives received useful presents of baskets and clothes-pegs, and every now and
then half a dozen wild ducks were found on the threshold in the morning. The
clergyman was treated in a similar manner; and being known to have a penchant
for snipes and woodcocks, his table was well supplied in the season. Sometimes
there were other things left in a mysterious way at the door—such as a
bladder full of the finest brandy or Hollands gin, or a packet of tobacco or
snuff.
</p>

<p>
This was generally after the visit of the gipsy tribe, who were smugglers to a
considerable extent. No farmer ever missed a lamb or a horse: such property was
far safer since the settlement of the Dismal Swamp.
</p>

<p>
But now the village had attacked the Swamp, the Swamp retaliated on the
village, and a regular war commenced. The farmers’ sheep began to
disappear—none so often as old Sibbold’s. Once a valuable horse of
his was lost. This drove him to the verge of frenzy. He went down to the Swamp,
and presently returned swearing and vowing vengeance—he had been shot at.
This aroused the clergyman into action. He went to the Swamp, and was received
with respect. He talked of conciliation, and reproved them, especially speaking
of the sin of murder. They listened, but utterly scouted the idea.
</p>

<p>
“We steal,” they said, openly. “It is our revenge; but we do
not murder. Sibbold was not fired at. One of our young men was seeking
ducks—he did not know that Sibbold at the same moment was creeping
noiselessly through the reeds to fire our huts. He shot at the ducks, and some
of the pellets glanced off Sibbold’s jack-boots. That’s the
truth.”
</p>

<p>
And it was the truth. But Sibbold vowed vengeance, and was heard to say that he
would have their blood. He refused to see the clergyman who came to mediate and
explain. He accused him of complicity, and reviled him.
</p>

<p>
James, as usual, agreed with and seconded him. Arthur sided with the squatters,
and said so openly. Sibbold cursed him. Arthur said pointedly that when he
inherited the land the squatters should be unmolested. Sibbold struck him with
an ash stick.
</p>

<p>
Arthur left the house and went to the Swamp. He called on old Will Baskette,
and expressed his hatred of his father’s tyranny. He asked to be taught
to make baskets, and to be initiated into the gipsy mysteries. He was a quick
lad, and they took an interest in teaching him. He soon knew how to make two or
three kinds of baskets, learnt the gipsy language, and imbibed their singular
traditions.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the war continued. At first the farmers and villagers put up with
patience with their thefts, considering that it was Sibbold’s fault. But
repeated losses exasperated them. If one of the Dismal Swamp people was seen
abroad he was set upon and maltreated, beaten black and blue. Savage dogs were
hounded at them. Sibbold was encouraged to eject them. He tried to get a posse
of constables to do so, but the constables hung back. They had heard the story
of the shooting at Sibbold; they knew these men to be desperate characters; and
most of them had had presents of brandy and tobacco, and ribbons for their
wives.
</p>

<p>
They could not be got to move. That was a lawless age in outlying places.
Finding this, the village began to contemplate a raid <i>en masse</i> upon the
Swamp. Nothing was talked of in the alehouse but fighting. Men compared the
length of their gun-barrels, and put up marks to prove the range of their shot.
The younger men were ready for the fray, the elders hesitated. They looked at
their thatched houses, at their barns and ricks. The insurance companies had
not then penetrated into the most obscure nooks and corners.
</p>

<p>
After all, the Swamp people were not unsupported: they were a branch of a
tribe. If they were seriously injured the tribe might return, and no one could
calculate the consequences.
</p>

<p>
So the foray was put off from day to day. But the news that it was meditated
soon reached the Swamp, and made the dwellers there more desperate than ever.
Their thefts grew to such a height that nothing was safe. The geese and turkeys
disappeared; wheat was stolen from the barns; sheep were taken by the dozen,
and no trace could be found. Now and then a horse disappeared. It came to such
a pitch that the very beer in the barrels, the cider in the cellar, was not
safe, but was taken nightly.
</p>

<p>
Old Sibbold, of course, suffered most. Tapping a cider barrel, he found it
quite empty. The old man was beside himself with rage; but he said nothing. He
studied retaliation. He watched his barns—the wheat seemed to disappear
under his very eyes. One night as he was returning from his barn, carrying his
long-barrelled flint-lock under his arm, he fancied he saw a gleam of light in
the ivy, which almost hid the cellar window. Stealthily he peeped through.
There was a man stooping down, drawing off the cider from a barrel into a
bucket.
</p>

<p>
Old Sibbold’s lips compressed; a fire came into his eyes. He grasped his
gun. Just then the thief held up the candle in his left hand, and revealed the
features of old Will Baskette, the very chief of the Swamp. Sibbold hated him
more particularly because he knew that Arthur frequented his hut. Up went the
long gun. The gleam of light from the candle guided the aim. The muzzle was
close to the lattice window. A cruel eye glanced along the barrel, a finger was
on the trigger. The flint struck the steel with a sharp snick—a spark
flew out—an explosion—the window-glass smashed—a cloud of
smoke—one groan, and all was still.
</p>

<p>
Sibbold rushed round the house, opened the door gently, locked it behind him,
and stole upstairs. On the landing he met his youngest son James. For a moment
they looked at one another. The young man spoke first.
</p>

<p>
“Quick, and load your gun,” he said. “Then put it in the rack
and get into bed. Give me your breeches.”
</p>

<p>
They wore breeches and gaiters in those days.
</p>

<p>
The old man did as he was bid. The gun was put in the rack; old Sibbold got
into bed. James took his breeches, poured a bucket of water on them, and hung
them up in the wide chimney—the embers still glowed on the hearth. Then
he stole upstairs.
</p>

<p>
“Arthur is out,” he whispered, as he passed the old man’s
bedroom.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes passed. Then there arose clatter of feet and a shouting.
</p>

<p>
“Farmer! farmer! your house is a-fire. The thatch be caught
alight.”
</p>

<p>
James opened the window, yawned, and asked what was the matter.
</p>

<p>
“Father’s asleep,” he said, as if not comprehending them.
“He got wet in the brook, and went to bed early. Can’t ye come in
the morning?”
</p>

<p>
But the others soon roused the house.
</p>

<p>
The thatch had indeed caught over the cellar window; but fortunately it was
nearly covered with moss and weeds, and was easily put out.
</p>

<p>
Then some one noticed the smashed window. “Who was it fired?” they
asked. “We heard a shot, and thought it was the swampers. We were
watching our sheep and barns. Then we saw this fire in your thatch, and ran.
Who was it fired? How came the window smashed like this? How came the thatch
alight?” James answered, “He really did not know. He had heard no
shot, he slept sound, knew nothing of the thatch being on fire, and they would
have been burnt in their beds if it had not been for their kind
neighbours.” Old Sibbold stood and shivered in his shirt, his breeches
were wet. The neighbours came in.
</p>

<p>
“I’ll go upstairs and fetch father a blanket to wrap his knees
in,” said James. “Father, thee blow the embers up; John Andrews,
thee knows where the cellar is: give ’em the key, father, and do you go,
John, and draw some cider.”
</p>

<p>
Away went John Andrews with the lantern, and came back with a face white as a
sheet, just as James got downstairs. There was a dead man in the cellar, in a
flood of gore and cider!
</p>

<p>
The result was a coroner’s inquiry; the thefts and so forth might have
gone on for ever, but death could not be disregarded. Even in that lawless age,
death was attended to. An inquest was held, and the jury was composed of the
farmers of the village. Suspicion fell very strongly upon old Sibbold. The
Swamp people openly denounced him as the murderer. His neighbours, much as they
hated the Swamp, believed in their hearts that they were right; and not all
their class prejudice could overcome the innate horror they felt in his
presence. More than one had heard him say he would have blood. Now there was
blood enough.
</p>

<p>
Still there was not enough evidence to arrest Sibbold. The Swamp people said he
would run away, and if he did they would watch him and bring him back. But
Sibbold did nothing of the kind. He faced the inquiry with a stern dignity
which imposed on some.
</p>

<p>
First came the medical evidence. The doctor proved that the shot had entered
the left side, just below the heart, and had passed downwards. It had entered
all together—the pellets not spread about, but close together, like a
bullet, which proved that the gun had been fired very close. Death must have
been absolutely instantaneous. Deceased was in a stooping posture when he
received the charge.
</p>

<p>
The constable who had examined the premises, declared it as his
belief—as, indeed, it was the belief of everyone present—that the
shot had been fired from without the window. The shot itself could not have
smashed every pane—that was the concussion. The thatch had been doubtless
set on fire by a piece of the paper which had been used as wadding.
</p>

<p>
When this had been said there was nothing more to be done, at least so the jury
thought. Suspect Sibbold as much as they would, they were determined to protect
him if possible. This was partly class-feeling, and partly remembrance of the
provocation.
</p>

<p>
But the Coroner was not to be put off so easily. He had Sibbold called, and
questioned him closely. He called James also, but they both stuck to their
tale; they had never heard the shot, etc. The Coroner sent for Sibbold’s
gun, keeping Sibbold and James at the inn where the inquest was held meantime.
It was brought. It told no tales: it was loaded. Finally, the Coroner, still
dissatisfied and vaguely suspicious, called <i>Arthur</i> Sibbold, who, white
as a sheet, was sitting near on a bench watching the proceedings.
</p>

<p>
He started at his name and looked round, but finally came forward. Where had he
been that night? He was at Bassett, a small town six miles distant. What was
his business there? what time did he leave? and so on. Arthur answered, but not
so clearly as was desired. He contradicted himself as to the time at which he
left Bassett, and got confused.
</p>

<p>
The Coroner’s suspicions shifted upon him. He must have arrived about the
time the shot was heard, yet he did not go indoors, did not show himself till
breakfast-time next morning. James vouched for that, unasked. What was he doing
all night?
</p>

<p>
Suspicion fell very strong on Arthur. But at this moment the wife of the
deceased started forward and declared her belief in his innocence, recounting
how he had learnt basket-making, etc, of the dead man, and they had been on the
most friendly terms.
</p>

<p>
Still, said the Coroner, he might have mistaken his man in the uncertain light.
Had he a gun? It was shown that the three Sibbolds had but one gun; that Arthur
never used a gun, being of a tender nature, and often expressing his dislike to
see birds wantonly slaughtered.
</p>

<p>
The Sibbolds were then, with the other witnesses, ordered out, and the Coroner
addressed the jury.
</p>

<p>
He told them plainly where his suspicions lay: one of the Sibbolds, he was
certain, did the deed, but which? Two were in bed, or at least were to all
appearance in bed, and one point in their favour was that the thatch was
alight. Now, if they had known that, they would hardly have lain till the
neighbours came up. The third was out that night, and, according to his own
showing, must have returned about the time the murder was committed. But in his
favour it was urged that he was on the best of terms with the deceased; that he
had no gun of his own; that he disliked the use of a gun. He said much more,
but these were the chief points, and particularly he laid down the law. They
must not imagine because a man was stealing that thereby his life was at any
one’s mercy. If a struggle took place, and the thief was killed in the
struggle, there were then several loopholes of escape from the penalty of the
law. First, it might be called chance-medley; next, there would be a doubt
whether the stab or shot was not given in self-defence, and was not intended to
kill. But in this case there was every appearance of deliberate murder. The
thief had been spied at the cask; the murderer had coolly aimed along his gun
and fired, hitting his man in a vital part, evidently of design and
aforethought.
</p>

<p>
He then left the jury to their deliberations. They talked it over half an hour
in a sullen manner, and then <i>returned an open verdict</i>—“Found
dead.” The Coroner remonstrated, and recommended that at least it should
be “Wilful murder against persons unknown,” but they were
obstinate.
</p>

<p>
That verdict stands to this day. The dread spectre of the gallows vanished from
Wolf’s Glow. Old Will Baskette was buried in the churchyard, and his
funeral was attended by the whole of the Swamp people and half the village. And
over their ale the farmers whispered that it served the old thief right, but
they avoided old Sibbold. The work of the rats had already brought fruit in
bloodshed.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Three.</h3>

<p>
In these days such a verdict and such an ending to a tragedy would be out of
the question; but there were no police in those times to take up a case if it
chanced to slip by the Coroner. Once past the Coroner, and the criminal was
practically safe. The county officers were never in a hurry for such
prosecutions, for a gallows cost at least 300 pounds. They wanted a public
prosecutor then ten times more than we do now. Sibbold was shunned by the very
men who had acquitted him; but there is no reason to suppose he ever felt
remorse. He was made of that kind of stuff of which the men in armour, his
ancestors, were composed, who thought little or nothing of human life. But one
day he met Arthur, his eldest son, face to face upon the stairs. It was the
first time they had met since the inquest—Arthur had avoided the place,
and wandered about a good deal by himself, till some simple folk began to think
that it was he who had committed the deed, and that his conscience was
troubling him.
</p>

<p>
This meeting on the stairs took place by accident one morning—Sibbold was
going to pass, but Arthur put his hand on his shoulder, “I saw you do
it,” he said. He had just entered the rick yard when the shot was fired.
He had held his peace, but his mind could not rest. “I cannot stay
here,” he said, “I am going. I shall never see you again.”
</p>

<p>
Old Sibbold stood like a stone; but presently put his hand in his pocket and
held out his purse.
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Arthur; “not a penny of that, it would be blood
money.”
</p>

<p>
He went, and evil report went after him. Perhaps it was James who fanned the
flame, but for years afterwards it was always believed that Arthur had shot the
basket-maker. Only the Swamp people combated the notion. Arthur was one of
them, and understood their language—it was impossible. Not to have to
return to these times, it will be, perhaps, best to at once finish with old
Sibbold; though the event did not really happen till some time after
Arthur’s departure.
</p>

<p>
Sibbold went to a fair at some twenty miles distance—a yearly custom of
his; and returning home in the evening, he was met by highwaymen, it is
supposed, and refusing to give up his money bag, was shot. At all events his
horse came home riderless, and the body of the old man was found on the heath
divested of every article of value. Suspicion at once fell on his known
enemies, the Swamp people. Their cottages were searched and nothing found.
Their men were interrogated, but had all been either at home or in another
direction. Calm reason put down Sibbold’s death to misadventure with
highwaymen, common enough in those times; but there were those who always held
that it was done in revenge, as it was believed that the gipsies retained the
old vendetta creed.
</p>

<p>
As Arthur did not return, James took possession, and went on as usual; but he
did not disturb the Swamp settlement. He avoided them, and they avoided him.
</p>

<p>
When Will Baskette was shot he left a widow and two sons, one of them was
strong and hardy, the other, about sixteen, was delicate and unfit for rough
outdoor life. This fact was well-known to the clergyman at Wolf’s Glow,
the Rev. Ralph Boteler, who was really a benevolently-minded man.
</p>

<p>
The widow and her eldest son joined the gipsy tribe and abandoned the Swamp.
The Rev. Ralph Boteler took the delicate Romy Baskette into his service as man
of all work, meaning to help in the garden and clean the parson’s nag.
Romy could not read, and the parson taught him—also to write. Being quiet
and good-looking, the lad won on the vicar, who after a time found himself
taking a deep interest in the friendless orphan. It ended in Romy leaving the
garden and the stable, and being domiciled in the studio, where the parson
filled his head with learning, not forgetting Latin and Greek.
</p>

<p>
The vicar was a single man, middle-aged, with very little thought beyond his
own personal comfort, except that he liked to see the hounds throw off, being
too stout to follow them. He had, however, one hobby; and, like other men who
are moderate enough upon other topics, he was violence itself upon this. Of all
the hobbies in the world, this parson’s fancy was geology—then just
beginning to emerge as a real science.
</p>

<p>
The neighbours thought the vicar was as mad as a March hare on this one point.
He grubbed up the earth in forty places with a small mattock he had made on
purpose at the village blacksmith’s. He broke every stone in the district
with a hammer which the same artisan made for him.
</p>

<p>
His craze was that the neighbourhood of Wolf’s Glow was rich in the two
great stores of nature which make countries powerful—i.e. in Coal and
Iron. He proved it in twenty ways. First, the very taste of the water, and the
colour of the earth in the streams; by the nodules of dark, heavy stone which
abounded; by the oily substance often found floating on the surface of
ponds—rock oil; by the strata and the character of the fossils; by actual
analysis of materials picked up by himself; lastly, by archaeology.
</p>

<p>
Wolf’s Glow! What was the meaning of that singular name? The only Glow in
the county. Wolf was, perhaps, a man’s name in the centuries since. But
Glow? Glow was, without a doubt, the ancient British for <i>coal</i>.
</p>

<p>
The people who argued against him—and they were all he
met—ridiculed the idea of the ancient Britons knowing anything of coal.
Boteler produced his authorities to show that they, and their conquerors the
Romans, were perfectly familiar with that mineral. Wolf’s Glow was, in
fact, Wolf’s Coal Pit. “Very well,” said the Objectors,
“show us the coal pit, and we’ll believe.” This the vicar
could not do, and was held to be mad accordingly.
</p>

<p>
But all this talking, and searching, and analysing made a deep impression upon
the mind of young Romy Baskette, who was now hard upon twenty years of age.
Boteler, really desirous of pushing the lad on, sent him to London, whither
Arthur Sibbold had preceded him, and placed him, at a high premium, in the care
of a friend of his, who was in the iron trade. Romy grew and prospered, and
being of a serious disposition saved all the money he could lay hands on.
Presently old Boteler died, and left him, not all, but a great share of his
worldly wealth. With this he bought a share in the iron business, and became a
partner. Wealth rolled in upon him, and at an early period of life he retired
from active labour, married, and bought an estate a few miles from Wolf’s
Glow.
</p>

<p>
In his leisure hours the memory of the old days with the vicar returned. He
resolved to test the vicar’s theory. He purchased a small piece of land
in Wolf’s Glow parish, sank a shaft, and sure enough came upon
<i>coal</i>.
</p>

<p>
This discovery revivified the whole man. He cast off sloth, forgot all about
retirement, and plunged into business again. Another search, conducted by
practical hands, proved the existence of iron.
</p>

<p>
There was a <i>furore</i>. Collieries were started; iron furnaces set going. It
was just at the dawn of the great iron and coal trade. The railways had been
started, and the demand was greater than the supply. Romy Baskette and Company
soon employed two thousand hands coal-digging and iron-smelting. The man, in
fact, wore himself out at the trade of money-making. He could not rest. Night
and day his brain was at work: An accidental conversation with one of his
workmen suggested to him a new idea. The smiths of the time could not make
nails fast enough for all the building that was going on. This workman had been
a sailor in his day, and had seen nails abroad which were made in batches by
machinery, instead of slowly and laboriously, one by one, by hand.
</p>

<p>
Baskette caught at the idea. He studied and learnt what he could. He made a
voyage himself abroad, and soon mastered the secret. He erected machinery, and
<i>cut</i> nails were first made. The consumption was enormous. The business of
this Baskette and Company became so large that it almost passed out of control.
Meantime other firms had come and settled, bought land, dug up coal, and set up
smelting furnaces. In ten years the population from being absolutely nil rose
to thirty-five thousand people. By this time Romy had killed himself. But that
mattered little, for he had left a son, and a son who inherited all his genius,
and was—if anything still “harder in the mouth.” He was
named, from his mother’s family, Sternhold Baskette.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold picked up the plough-handle which had dropped from his father’s
grasp, and continued the good work, never once looking back. But although
equally clever, the bent of his genius was different from that of old Romy.
Romy was at heart a speculator, and believed in personal property. Sternhold
was a Conservative, and put his faith in real property, houses, and land. He
kept up the old forges and collieries, but he started no new ones. He invested
the money in land and houses, particularly the latter. His life may be summed
up in two strokes of genius—the first was bringing the iron horse to
Stirmingham, as the new town was called; the second was the building lease
investment.
</p>

<p>
It is hard to give the pre-eminence to either. They were both profound
schemes—neither would have been complete without the other. He did not
originate the idea of the railway—that was done for him—but he put
it on its legs, and he brought it to the centre of the town.
</p>

<p>
The original scheme almost omitted Stirmingham. Railways were not then fully
understood; their projectors had such vast ideas in their heads, they aimed at
long trunk lines, and so this railroad was to connect London, the sea, and a
certain large town—larger than Stirmingham then, but now nothing beside
the modern city.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold, as the largest shareholder, and as finding the capital to get
through Parliament, prevailed to have the course altered so as to sweep by
Stirmingham. He knew that this would improve his property there at least fifty
per cent. But he had other ideas in his head. The line could not be finished
under three years, and in those three years it was his intention to become
possessed of the whole ground upon which the town of Stirmingham stood. He
foresaw that it would become a mighty centre. He braced up his nerves, and
prepared to spend his darling hoards like water.
</p>

<p>
One by one the fields, the plots, the houses, became his; and the greed growing
on him, he cast longing eyes on the adjacent marsh, now called Glow’s
Lea.
</p>

<p>
The solicitors he employed tried to restrain his infatuation. They represented
to him that even his vast wealth could not sustain this more than kingly
expenditure, and as to the marsh, it was sheer madness to purchase it. In vain.
Perhaps a tinge of pride had something to do with it. He would buy up the
rotten old Swamp where his progenitor had dwelt, drain it, and cover it with
mansions.
</p>

<p>
But now came a difficulty—the title to the ground was not all that could
be wished. James had been dead some years, but it was well-known that had
Arthur returned—if Arthur still lived, or his heirs—that James had
no right. He had enjoyed the farm and the land, such as it was, unmolested, all
his life. He had married, and had eight sons. Six of these had married since,
and most of them had children.
</p>

<p>
As none could claim the property, they all found a miserable livelihood upon
it, somehow or other. They had degenerated into a condition little better than
that of the squatters in the Swamp.
</p>

<p>
Three families lived in the farmhouse, constantly quarrelling; two made their
dwelling in the cowsheds, slightly improved; one boiled the pot in the great
carthouse, and the two single men slept in the barn. Such a condition of
slovenliness and dirt it would be hard to equal. And the language, the
fighting, and the immorality are better left undescribed! The clergyman of
Wolfs Glow wished them further.
</p>

<p>
To these wretches the offers of Sternhold Baskette came like the promised land.
He held out 300 pounds apiece, on condition that they would jointly sign the
deed and then go to America. They jumped at it. The solicitor warned Baskette
that the contract was not sound. He asked, in reply, if any one could produce
the deed under which the property descended by “heirship.” No one
could. Somehow or other it had been lost.
</p>

<p>
In less than a month eight Sibbolds, with their wives and families, were <i>en
route</i> to the United States, and Sternhold took possession. Then came the
Swamp settlement difficulty.
</p>

<p>
At first Baskette thought of carrying matters with a high hand. The squatters
said they had lived there for two generations, or nearly so, and had paid no
rent. They had a right. Sternhold remembered that they were of his clan. He
gave them the same terms as the Sibbolds—and they took them. Three
hundred pounds to such miserable wretches seemed an El Dorado.
</p>

<p>
They signed a deed, and went to America, filling up half a vessel, for there
were seventeen heads of families, and children <i>ad libitum</i>.
</p>

<p>
Thus Sternhold bought the farm and the Swamp for 7500 pounds. His aim in
getting them to America was that no question of right might crop up—for
the Cunard line was not then what it is now, and the passage was expensive and
protracted. He reckoned that they would spend the money soon after landing, and
never have a chance of returning.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the railway came to a standstill. There had been inflation—vast
sums of promotion money had been squandered in the usual reckless manner, and
ruin stared the shareholders in the face. To Sternhold it meant absolute loss
of all, and above everything, of prestige.
</p>

<p>
Already the keen business men of the place began to sneer at him. At any cost
the railway must be kept on its legs. He sacrificed a large share of his
wealth, and the works recommenced. The old swamp, or marsh, was drained.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold had determined to make this the Belgravia of Stirmingham, and had the
plans prepared accordingly. They were something gigantic in costliness and
magnificence. His best friends warned and begged him to desist. No; he would go
on. Stirmingham would become the finest city in England, and he should be the
richest man in Europe. Up rose palatial mansions, broad streets, splendid
club-houses—even the foundations of a theatre were laid. And all this was
begun at once. Otherwise, Sternhold was afraid that the compass of an ordinary
life would not enable him to see these vast designs finished. So that one might
walk through streets with whole blocks of houses only one story high.
</p>

<p>
Everything went on swimmingly, till suddenly the mania for speculation which
had taken possession of all the kingdom received a sudden check by the failure
of a certain famous railway king.
</p>

<p>
As if by magic, all the mighty works at Stirmingham ceased, and Sternhold grew
sombre, and wandered about with dejected step. His friends, men of business,
reminded him of their former warnings. He bent his head, bit his lip, and said
only, “Wait!”
</p>

<p>
Meantime the line had been constructed, but was not opened. The metals were
down, but the stations were not built, and the locomotives had not arrived.
Everybody was going smash. Several collieries failed; land and houses became
cheap. Sternhold invested his uttermost in the same property—bought
houses, till he had barely enough to keep him in bread and cheese. Still they
laughed and jeered at him, and still he said only, “Wait!”
</p>

<p>
This place, this swamp, seemed to be fated to demonstrate over and over again
at one time the futility of human calculation, and at another what enormous
things can be accomplished by the efforts of a clever man.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Four.</h3>

<p>
The owner of three parts of Stirmingham—now a monstrous overgrown city,
just building a cathedral—actually had nothing but a little bread and
cheese for supper. There were people who condoled with him, and offered to lend
him sums of money—not large, but very useful to a starving man, one would
have thought. He shrugged his shoulders and said, “Thank you; I’ll
wait.”
</p>

<p>
Certain keen speculators tried to come round him in twenty different ways. They
represented that all this mass of bricks and mortar—this unfinished
Belgravia—really was not worth owning; no one could ever find the coin to
finish the plans, and house property had depreciated ninety per cent.
</p>

<p>
“Very true,” said Sternhold. “Good morning, gentlemen.”
</p>

<p>
He held on like grim death. Men of genius always do—mark Caesar, and all
of them. ’Tis the bulldog that wins.
</p>

<p>
By-and-by things began to take a turn. The markets looked up. Iron and coal got
brisker. The first locomotive was put on the line, then another, and another;
London could be reached in two hours, goods could be transmitted in six,
instead of thirty by the old canal or turnpike.
</p>

<p>
The Stock Exchange got busy again. You could hear the masons and
bricklayers—chink, tink, tinkle, as their trowels chipped off the
edges—singing away in chorus. The whistle of the engines was never
silent. Vast clouds of smoke hung over the country from the factories and
furnaces. Two or three new trades were introduced—among others, the
placed goods, cheap jewellery, and idol-making businesses, and trade-guns for
Africa. Rents began to rise; in two years they went up forty per cent. The
place got a name throughout the length and breadth of the kingdom, and a Name
is everything to a town as well as to an individual.
</p>

<p>
But by a curious contradiction, just as his property began to rise in value,
and his investment looked promising, Sternhold grew melancholy and walked about
more wretched than ever. The truth soon leaked out—he had no money to
complete his half-finished streets and blocks of houses. Nothing could induce
him to borrow; not a halfpenny would he take from any man.
</p>

<p>
There the streets and houses, the theatres, club-houses, magnificent mansions,
huge hotels, languished, half-finished, some a story, some two stories high,
exposed to wind and weather. In the midst of a great city there was all this
desolation, as if an enemy had wreaked his vengeance on this quarter only.
</p>

<p>
Large as were the sums derived from his other properties—houses and shops
and land, which were occupied—it was all eaten up in the attempt to
finish this <i>marble</i> Rome in the middle of a brick Babylon. Heavy amounts
too had to be disbursed to keep the railway going, for it did not pay a
fraction of dividend yet. Men of business pressed on Sternhold. “Let us
complete the place,” they said. “Sell it to us on building leases;
no one man can do the whole. Then we will form three or four companies or
syndicates, lease it of you, complete the buildings, and after seventy years
the whole will revert to you or your heirs.”
</p>

<p>
Still Sternhold hesitated. At last he did lease a street or two in this way to
a company, who went to work like mad, paid the masons and bricklayers double
wages, kept them at it day and night, and speedily were paying twenty per cent,
dividends on their shares out of the rents of the completed buildings. This
caused a rush. Company after company was formed. They gave Sternhold heavy
premiums for the privilege to buy of him; even then it was difficult to get him
to grant the leases. When he did accept the terms and the ready cash, every
halfpenny of it went to complete streets on his own account; and so he lived,
as it were, from hand to mouth.
</p>

<p>
After all this excitement and rush, after some thousands of workmen were put at
it, they did not seem to make much impression upon the huge desolation of brick
and mortar. Streets and squares rose up, and still there were acres upon acres
of wilderness, foundations half-dug out and full of dirty water, walls three
feet high, cellars extending heaven only knew where.
</p>

<p>
People came for miles to see it, and called it “Baskette’s
Folly.” After a while, however, they carefully avoided it, and called it
something worse—i.e. “The Rookery;” for all the scum and
ruffianism of an exceptionally scummy and ruffianly residuum chose it as their
stronghold. Thieves and worse—ill-conditioned women—crowds of lads,
gipsies, pedlars—the catalogue would be as long as
Homer’s—took up their residence in these foundations and cellars.
They seized on the planks which were lying about in enormous piles, and roofed
over the low walls; and where planks would not do they got canvas.
</p>

<p>
Now, it is well-known that this class of people do not do much harm when they
are scattered about and separated here, there, and everywhere over a city; but
as soon as they are concentrated in one spot, then it becomes serious. Gangs
are formed, they increase in boldness; the police are defied, and not a house
is safe.
</p>

<p>
This place became a crying evil. The papers raved about it, the police (there
were police now) complained and reported it to head-quarters. There was a
universal clamour. By this time Stirmingham had got a corporation, aldermen,
and mayor, who met in a gorgeous Guildhall, and were all sharp men of business.
Now the corporation began to move in this matter of “Baskette’s
Folly.” Outside people gave them the credit of being good citizens,
animated by patriotic motives, anxious for the honour of their town, and
desirous of repressing crime. Keen thinkers knew better—the Corporation
was not above a good stroke of business. However, what they did was this: After
a great deal of talk and palaver, and passing resolutions, and consulting
attorneys, and goodness knows what, one morning a deputation waited upon
Sternhold Baskette, Esq, at his hotel (he always lived at an hotel), and laid
before him a handsome proposition. It was to the effect that he should lease
them the said “Folly,” or incomplete embryo city, for a term of
years, in consideration whereof they would pay down a certain sum, and contract
to erect buildings according to plans and specifications agreed upon, the whole
to revert in seventy years to Sternhold or his heirs.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold fought hard—he asked for extravagant terms, and had to be
brought to reason by a threat of an appeal by the Corporation to Parliament for
a private Act.
</p>

<p>
This sobered him, for he was never quite happy in his secret mind about his
title. Terms were agreed upon, the earnest money paid, and the masons began to
work. Then suddenly there was an uproar. The companies or syndicates who had
leased portions of the estate grew alarmed lest this enormous undertaking
should, when finished, depreciate their property. They cast about for means of
opposing it. It is said—but I cannot believe it—that they gave
secret pay to the thieves and ruffians in the cellars to fight the masons and
bricklayers, and drive them off.
</p>

<p>
At all events serious collisions occurred. But the Corporation was too strong.
They telegraphed to London and got reinforcements, and carried the
entrenchments by storm.
</p>

<p>
Then, so goes the discreditable rumour, the companies bribed the masons and
bricklayers, who built so badly that every now and then houses fell in, and
there was a fine loss! Finally they got up an agitation, cried down the
Corporation for wasting public funds, and, what was far more serious, brought
high legal authority to prove that <i>as a Corporation</i> they had no power to
pledge themselves to such terms as they had, or indeed to enter into such a
contract without polling the whole city.
</p>

<p>
This alarmed the Corporation. There were secret meetings and long faces. But if
one lawyer discovers a difficulty, another can always suggest a way round the
corner. The Corporation went to Parliament, and got a private Act; but they did
not go as a body. They went through Sternhold, who was persuaded; and indeed it
looked plausible, that by so doing, and by getting the sanction of the House of
Commons, he improved his own title.
</p>

<p>
Then the Corporation smiled, and built away faster than ever. In the course of
an almost incredibly short time the vast plans of Sternhold were completed by
the various companies, by the Corporation, and by himself; for every penny he
got as premium, every penny of ground-rent, every penny from his collieries,
iron furnaces, and cut-nail factories, went in bricks and mortar. It was the
most magnificent scheme, perhaps, ever started by a single man. The city was
proud of it. Like Augustus, he had found it brick, and left it marble.
</p>

<p>
Yet, in reality, he was no richer. The largest owner, probably, of house
property in the world, he could but just pay his way at his hotel. Although he
had a fine country house (which old Romy had purchased) in the suburbs, he
never used it—it was let. He preferred a hotel as a single man because
there was no trouble to look after servants, etc. He lived in the most
economical manner—being obliged to, in fact.
</p>

<p>
Yet this very economy increased the popular belief in his riches. He was a
miser. Give a man that name, let it once stick to him, and there is no limit to
the fables that will be eagerly received as truth. Give a dog a bad name and
hang him. Call a man a miser, and, if he is so inclined, he can roll in
borrowed money, dine every day on presents of game and fish, and marry any one
he chooses. I only wish I had the reputation.
</p>

<p>
No one listened to Sternhold’s constant reiteration of what was
true—that he was really poor. It was looked upon as the usual
stock-in-trade language of a miser. His fame spread. Popular rumour magnified
and magnified the tale till it became like a chapter from the Arabian Nights.
</p>

<p>
After all, there was some grain of truth in it. If he could have grasped all
that was his, he would have surpassed all that was said about his riches.
</p>

<p>
At last the <i>Stirmingham Daily News</i> hit upon a good idea to out-distance
its great rival the <i>Stirmingham Daily Post</i>. This idea was a “Life
of Sternhold Baskette, the Miser of Stirmingham.” After, the editor had
considered a little, he struck out “miser,” and wrote
“capitalist”—it had a bigger sound.
</p>

<p>
The manuscript was carefully got up in secret by the able editor and two of his
staff, who watched Sternhold like detectives, and noted all his peculiarities
of physiognomy and manner. They knew—these able editors know
everything—that the public are particularly curious how much salt and
pepper their heroes use, what colour necktie they wear, and so on. As the
editor said, they wanted to make Sternhold the one grand central
figure—perfect, complete in every detail. And they did it.
</p>

<p>
They traced his origin and pedigree—this last was not quite accurate, but
near enough. They devoted 150 pages to a mere catalogue of his houses, his
streets, his squares, club-houses, theatres, hotels, railways, collieries,
ironworks, nail factories, estates, country mansions, etc. They wrote 200 pages
of speculations as to the actual value of this enormous property; and modestly
put the total figure at “something under twenty millions, and will be
worth half as much again in ten years.” They did not forget the building
leases; when these fell in, said the memoir, he or his heirs would have an
income of 750,000 pounds per annum.
</p>

<p>
They carefully chronicled the fact that the capitalist had never married, that
he had no son or daughter, that he was growing old, or, at least, past middle
age, and had never been known to recognise any one as his relation (having, in
fact, shipped the whole family to America). What a glorious thing this would be
for some lucky fellow! They finished up with a photograph of Sternhold himself.
This was difficult to obtain. He was a morose, retiring man—he had never,
so far as was known, had his portrait taken. It was quite certain that no
persuasion would induce him to sit for it. The able editor, however, was not to
be done. On some pretext or other Sternhold was got to the office of the paper,
and while he sat conversing with the editor, the photographer “took
him” through a hole made for the purpose in the wooden partition between
the editor’s and sub-editor’s room. As Sternhold was quite
unconscious, the portrait was really a very good one. Suddenly the world was
taken by storm with a “Life of Sternhold Baskette, the Capitalist of
Stirmingham. His enormous riches, pedigree, etc, 500 pages, post octavo,
illustrated, price 7 shillings 6 pence.”
</p>

<p>
The able editor did not confine himself to Stirmingham. Before the book was
announced he made his London arrangements, also with the lessees of the railway
bookstalls. At one and the same moment of time, one morning Stirmingham woke up
to find itself placarded with huge yellow bills (the <i>News</i> was Liberal
then—it turned its coat later on—and boasted that John Bright had
been to the office), boys ran about distributing handbills at every door, men
stood at the street corners handing them to everybody who passed.
</p>

<p>
Flaring posters were stuck up at every railway station in the kingdom; ditto in
London. The dead walls and hoardings were covered with yellow paper printed in
letters a foot long. Three hundred agents, boys, girls, and men, walked all
over the metropolis crying incessantly “Twenty Millions of Money,”
and handing bills and cards to every one. The <i>Athenaeum, Saturday Review,
Spectator</i>, and <i>Times</i>; every paper, magazine, review; every large
paper in the country had an advertisement. The result was something
extraordinary.
</p>

<p>
The name of Sternhold Baskette was on everybody’s lips. His “Twenty
Millions of Money” echoed from mouth to mouth, from Land’s End to
John o’ Groats. It crossed the Channel, it crossed the Alps, it crossed
the Atlantic and the Pacific. It was heard on the Peak of Teneriffe, and in the
cities of India.
</p>

<p>
The New York firms seized on it as a mine of wealth. The book, reprinted, was
sold from the Hudson River to the Rocky Mountains, and to the mouth of the
Mississippi for twenty cents. The circulation was even larger in the United
States than in Britain, for there everybody worshipped the dollar. The able
editor made his fortune. The book ran through thirty editions, and wore out two
printing machines and three sets of type. The two gentlemen of the staff who
had assisted in the compilation had a fair share, and speedily put on airs.
They claimed the authorship, though the idea had certainly originated with the
editor. There was a quarrel. They left, being offered higher salaries in this
way:—The other paper, the <i>Post</i>, though blue in principles, grew
green with envy, and tried to disparage as much as possible. They offered these
respectable gentlemen large incomes to cut the book to pieces that they
themselves had written. No one could do it better—no one understood the
weak points, and the humbug of the thing so well. The fellows went to work with
a will. The upshot was a little warfare between the Sternholders and the
anti-Sternholders. The <i>News</i> upheld Sternhold, stuck to everything it had
stated, and added more. The <i>Post</i> disparaged him in every possible way.
This newspaper war had its results, as we shall presently see. For the present
these two noble principled young men, who first wrote a book for pay and then
engaged to chop it into mincemeat for pay, may be left to search and search
into the Baskette by-gone history for fresh foul matter to pour forth on the
hero of Stirmingham.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Five.</h3>

<p>
“The Hero of Stirmingham;” so the <i>News</i> dubbed him; so it
became the fashion, either in ridicule or in earnest, to call him. People came
from all parts to see him. Every one who, on business or pleasure, came to the
city, tried to lodge at the hotel where he lived, or at least called there on
the chance of meeting the mortal representative of Twenty Millions Sterling.
The hotel proprietor, who had previously lost money by him, and execrated his
economy, now reaped a golden harvest, and found his business so large that he
set about building a monster place at one side of the original premises, for he
was afraid to pull it down lest the capitalist should leave.
</p>

<p>
Now a curious psychological change was wrought by all this in old
Sternhold’s character. Up till this period of his life he had been one of
the most retiring and reserved of men, morose, self-absorbed, shrinking from
observation. He now became devoured with an insatiable vanity. He could not
shake off the habit of economy, the frugal manner of living, which, he had so
long practised; but his mind underwent a complete revolution.
</p>

<p>
It has often been observed that when a man makes one particular subject his
study, in course of time that which was once clear grows obscure, and instead
of acquiring extraordinary insight, he loses all method, and wanders.
</p>

<p>
Something of the kind was the case with Sternhold. All his life had been
devoted to the one great object of owning a city, of being the largest
proprietor of houses and streets in the world. His whole thought, energy,
strength, patience—his entire being—had been concentrated upon this
end. In actual fact, it was not attained yet, for he was practically only the
nominal owner; but the publication of this book acted in a singular manner upon
his brain. He grew to believe that he really was all that the
“Life” represented him to be—i.e. the most extraordinary man
the world had ever seen.
</p>

<p>
He attempted no state, he set up no carriage; he stuck to his old confined
apartments at the hotel he had always frequented; but he lived in an ideal life
of sovereign grandeur. He talked as though he were a monarch—an absolute
autocrat—as if all the inhabitants of Stirmingham were his subjects; and
boasted that he could turn two hundred thousand people out of doors by a single
word.
</p>

<p>
In plain language, he lost his head; in still plainer language, he went
harmlessly mad—not so mad that any one even hinted at such a thing. There
was no lunacy in his appearance or daily life; but the great chords of the mind
were undoubtedly at this period of his existence quite deranged.
</p>

<p>
He really was getting rich now. The houses he had himself completed, with the
premiums paid for building leases, began to return a considerable profit. The
income from his collieries and factories was so large, that even bricks and
mortar could not altogether absorb it. Perhaps he was in receipt of three
thousand pounds per annum, or more. But now, unfortunately, just as the fruits
of his labour were fast ripening, this abominable book upset it all.
</p>

<p>
There can be no doubt that the editor of the <i>Stirmingham Daily News</i>,
with the best intentions in the world, dealt his Hero two mortal wounds. In the
first place, he drove him mad. Sternhold spent days and nights studying how he
could exceed what he had already done.
</p>

<p>
Dressed in a workman’s garb for disguise, he explored the whole
neighbourhood of Stirmingham, seeking fresh land to purchase. His object was to
get it cheap, for he knew that if there was the slightest suspicion that he was
after it, a high price would be asked. In some instances he succeeded. One or
two cases are known where he bought, with singular judgment and remarkable
shrewdness, large tracts for very small sums. He paid only one-fifth on
completion, leaving the remainder on mortgage. This enabled him to buy five
times as much at once as would have otherwise been possible.
</p>

<p>
But there were sharp fellows in Stirmingham, who watched the capitalist like
hawks, and soon spied out what was going on. Their game was to first discover
in what direction Sternhold was buying in secret, then to forestall him, and
nearly double the price when he arrived.
</p>

<p>
In this way Sternhold got rid of every shilling of his income. Even then he
might have prospered; but, as bad luck would have it, the railway, after two
millions of money had been sunk on it, actually began to pay dividends of three
and a half per cent, then four, then six; for a clever fellow had got at the
helm, and was forcing up the market so as to make hay while the sun shone.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold was in raptures with railways. Some sharp young men of forty-five and
fifty immediately laid their heads together, and projected a second railway at
almost right angles—not such a bad idea, but one likely to cause enormous
outlay. They represented to Sternhold that this new line would treble the value
of the property he had recently bought, extending for some miles beyond the
city. He jumped at it. The Bill was got through Parliament. One half of these
sharp young men were lawyers, the other half engineers and contractors.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold deposited the money, and they shared it between them. When the money
was exhausted the railway languished. This exasperated old Baskette. For the
first time in his life he borrowed money, and did it on a royal scale;—I
am almost afraid to say how much, and certainly it seems odd how people could
advance so much knowing his circumstances.
</p>

<p>
However, he got it. He bought up all the shares, and became practically owner
of the new line. He completed it, and rode on the first locomotive in triumph,
surrounded by his parasites. For alas! he had yielded to parasites at last, who
flattered and fooled him to perfection. This was the state of affairs when the
second mortal wound was given.
</p>

<p>
It happened in this way. The “Life of Sternhold Baskette, Esq,”
had, as was stated, got abroad, and penetrated even to the Rocky Mountains. It
was quoted, and long extracts made from it in the cheap press—they had a
cheap press in the United States thirty years before we had, which accounts for
the larger proportion of educated or partly educated people, and the wider
spread of intelligence. After a while, somehow or other, the marvellous story
reached the ears of one or two persons who happened to sign their names
Baskette, and they began to say to themselves, “What the deuce is this?
We rather guess we come from Stirmingham or somewhere thereabouts. Now, why
shouldn’t we share in this mine of wealth?”
</p>

<p>
The sharp Yankee intellect began to have “idees.” Most of the
cotters whom Sternhold had transhipped to America thirty years or more
previous, were dead and buried—that is to say, the old people were.
</p>

<p>
The air of America is too thin and fine, and the life too fast, for middle-aged
men who have been accustomed to the foggy atmosphere and the slow passage of
events in the Old Country. But it is a tremendous place for increase of
population.
</p>

<p>
The United States are only just a century old, and they have a population
larger than Great Britain, which has a history of twenty centuries, or nearly
so.
</p>

<p>
So it happened that, although the old people were dead, the tribe had
marvellously increased. Half who were transhipped had borne the name of
Baskette. This same question was asked in forty or fifty places at
once—“My name is Baskette; why should not I share?”
</p>

<p>
These people had, of course, little or no recollection of the deed signed by
their forefathers: and if they had had a perfect knowledge, such a trifling
difficulty as that was not one calculated to appal a Yankee’s ingenuity.
When once the question had been asked it was repeated, and grew and grew, and
passed from man to man, made its appearance in the newspapers, who even went so
far as to say that the finest city in England, the very workshop of the
Britishers, belonged to United States citizens.
</p>

<p>
Some editor keener than the rest, or who had read the book more carefully,
pointed out that the capitalist had no heirs living, that he had never been
married, and no one knew to whom all this vast wealth would descend.
</p>

<p>
Twenty millions sterling begging a heir! This was enough to set the American
mind aflame. It was just like applying a lighted match to one of their
petroleum wells.
</p>

<p>
The paragraph flew from paper to paper, was quoted, conned, and talked over.
Men grew excited. Presently, here and there one who considered that he had some
claim began to steal off to England to make inquiries. The Cunard were running
now, though they had not yet invented the “ocean highway,” by
keeping to a course nothing to the north or south of a certain line. Passage
was very quick, and not dear. In a little time the fact that one or two had
started oozed out, then others followed, and were joined by a lawyer or so,
till at last fourteen or fifteen keen fellows reached Stirmingham.
</p>

<p>
Now mark the acuteness of the American mind! Instead of announcing their
arrival, every one of these fellows kept quiet, and said not a word! When they
met each other in the streets they only smiled. They were not going to alarm
the game.
</p>

<p>
These gentlemen were not long in Stirmingham before they found out that the
<i>Stirmingham Daily Post</i> was a deadly enemy of old Sternhold. To the
office of the second able editor they tramped accordingly.
</p>

<p>
There they learnt a good deal; but in return the editor pumped something out of
them, and, being well up in the matter, sniffed out their objects. He chuckled
and rubbed his hands together. Here was a chance for an awful smash at the
<i>News</i>.
</p>

<p>
One fine morning out came a leading article referring also to several columns
of other matter on the same subject, headed “The Heirs of
Stirmingham.”
</p>

<p>
Being Blue, you see, the <i>Post</i> affected to abominate United States’
Republicanism and all the American institutions. This article recounted the
visit of the dozen or so of possible claimants, described them so minutely that
no one could help recognising them, and wound up with a tremendous peroration
calling upon all good citizens to do their best to prevent the renowned city of
Stirmingham falling into the hands of the Yankees!
</p>

<p>
Such property as Sternhold’s, the article argued, was of national
importance; and although the individual should not be interfered with, the
nation should see that its rights were not tampered with. There was danger of
such tampering, for who knew what an <i>infirm, old</i> man like Sternhold
might not be led to sign by interested parties? At his age he could not be
expected to possess the decision and mental firmness of earlier years. This was
a cruel hit at Sternhold’s mental weakness, which had begun to grow
apparent.
</p>

<p>
An endeavour should be made to find an English heir, and that there was such an
heir they (the staff of the <i>Post</i>) firmly believed. Two gentlemen of the
staff (meaning thereby the late writers for the <i>News</i>), who had devoted
some time to the matter, had made a certain important discovery. This was
nothing less than the fact that Sternhold had had an uncle! This in big capital
letters.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
An Uncle. Then followed a little bit of genealogy, in approved fashion, with
dashes, lines, etc—the meaning of which was that Sternhold’s
father, old Romy Baskette, had had a brother, who, when the original Will
Baskette was shot, had departed into the unknown with his mother.
</p>

<p>
What had become of Romy’s brother? The probability was that by this time
he was dead and buried. But there was also the probability that he had married
and had children. Those children, if they existed, were undoubtedly the nearest
heirs of Sternhold Baskette, Esq, now residing at Dodd’s Hotel, South
Street. As an earnest of the anxiety of the <i>Post</i> to preserve the good
city of Stirmingham from Yankee contamination, they now offered three
rewards:—First, fifty pounds for proof of Romy’s brother’s
death; secondly, one hundred pounds for proof of Romy’s brother’s
marriage, if he had married; thirdly, one hundred and fifty pounds for the
identification of his child or children. This was repeated as an advertisement
in the outer sheet, and was kept in type for months.
</p>

<p>
It deserves notice as being the first advertisement which appeared in the Great
Baskette Claim Case—the first of a crop of advertisements which in time
became a regular source of income to newspaper proprietors.
</p>

<p>
When this leading article and advertisement, supported by several columns of
descriptive matter and genealogies was laid on the breakfast tables of half
Stirmingham, it caused a sensation. The city suddenly woke up to the fact that
as soon as old Sternhold died half the place would have no owner.
</p>

<p>
The Yankee visitors now had no further reason for concealment. They went about
openly making inquiries. They were fêted at hotel bars and in billiard
rooms. They called upon Sternhold bodily—<i>en masse</i>—forced
themselves into his apartment, though, he shut the door with his own hands in
their faces, shook him by the hand, patted him on the shoulder, called him
“Colonel,” and asked him what he would take to drink!
</p>

<p>
They walked round him, admired him from every point of view, stuck their
fingers in his ribs, and really meant no harm, though their manners were not
quite of the drawing-room order.
</p>

<p>
They cut up the old man’s favourite armchair, whittled it up, to carry
away as souvenirs. They appropriated his books—his own particular
penholder, with which he had written every letter and signed every deed for
fifty years, disappeared, and was afterwards advertised as on show at
Barnum’s in New York City, as the Pen which could sign a cheque for
Twenty Millions!
</p>

<p>
When at last they did leave, one popped back, and asked if the
“Colonel” believed this story about his <i>Uncle</i>? He was sure
he had never had an uncle, wasn’t he? The old man sat silent, which the
inquirer took for once as a negative, and wrote a letter to the <i>News</i>,
denying the existence of Romy’s brother.
</p>

<p>
Poor old Sternhold was found by the landlord, old Dodd, sitting in his chair,
which was all cut and slashed, two hours afterwards, staring straight at the
wall.
</p>

<p>
Dodd feared he had an attack of paralysis, and ran for the nearest doctor; but
it was nothing but literally speechless indignation. After a while he got up
and walked about the room, and took a little dry sherry—his favourite
wine. But the mortal wound Number 2 had been given. Henceforth the one great
question in Sternhold’s mind was his heir.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Six.</h3>

<p>
His heir! Sternhold seriously believed that he had no living relations. It is
often said that poor people have plenty of children, while the rich, to whom
they would be welcome, have few or none. This was certainly a case in point.
The poor Baskettes, who had been shipped to America, had a whole tribe of
descendants. Here was a man who, nominally at least, was the largest owner of
property known, who was childless, and had already reached and exceeded the
allotted age of man.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold was seventy-two. He looked back and ransacked his memory. He had
never heard anything of this uncle, his father’s brother; his
mother’s friends were all dead. There was not a soul for whom he cared a
snap of his fingers. Firstly, he had no relations; secondly, he had no friends,
for Sternhold, wide as was his circle of acquaintances, had never been known to
visit any one. His life had been solitary and self-absorbed.
</p>

<p>
Now, for the first time, he felt his loneliness, and understood that he was a
solitary being. Who should be his heir? Who should succeed to that mighty
edifice he had slowly built up? The architect had been obliged to be content
with gazing upon the outside of his work only; but the successor, if he only
lived the usual time, would revel in realised magnificence unsurpassed. The old
man was quite staggered, and went about as in a dream.
</p>

<p>
The idea once started, there were plenty who improved upon it. The Corporation
at their meetings incidentally alluded to the matter, and it was delicately
suggested that Sternhold would crown his memory with ineffable glory if he
devised his vast estate to the city. Such a bequest in a few years would make
the place absolutely free from taxation. The rents would meet
poor’s-rates, gas-rates, water-rates, sanitary-rates, and all. One
gentleman read an elaborate series of statistics, proving that the income from
the property, when once the building leases fell in, would not only free the
city from local, but almost, if not quite, from imperial taxation. There were
many instances in history of kings, as rewards for great services, issuing an
order that certain towns should be exempt from the payment of taxes for a
series of years. Sternhold had it thus in his power to display really regal
munificence.
</p>

<p>
Other gentlemen of more radical leanings cried “Shame!” on the mere
fact of one man being permitted to attain such powers. It was absurd for one
man to possess such gigantic wealth, and for several hundred thousand to live
from hand to mouth. The people should share it, not as a gift, but as a right;
it should be seized for the benefit of the community.
</p>

<p>
The Corporation people were much too knowing to talk like this. They went to
work in a clever way. First, they contrived various great banquets, to which
Sternhold was invited, and at which he was put in the seat of honour and lauded
to the skies. Next, they formed a committee and erected a statue in a prominent
place to the founder of Stirmingham, and unveiled it with immense ceremony.
Certain funds had been previously set apart for the building of a public
library; this being completed about that time, was named the Sternhold
Institute. An open space or “park,” which the Corporation had been
obliged to provide for the seething multitudes who were so closely crowded
together, was called the Sternhold Public Park. Yet Sternhold never subscribed
a farthing to either of these.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was left undone to turn his head. His portrait, life-size, painted in
oil, was hung up in the Council-hall; medals were struck to commemorate his
birthday. The Corporation were not alone in their endeavours; other
disinterested parties were hard at work. Most energetic of all were the
religious people. Chapel projectors, preachers, church extension societies,
missionary associations, flew at his throat. His letter-box was flooded; his
door was for ever resounding with knocking and ringing. The sound of the true
clerical nasal twang was never silent in his anteroom. The hospitals came down
on him flat in one lump, more particularly those establishments which publicly
boast that they never solicit assistance, and are supported by voluntary
contributions caused by prayer.
</p>

<p>
The dodge is to publish the <i>fact</i> as loudly as possible. To proclaim that
the institution urgently wants a few thousands is not begging. A list of all
the charities that recommended themselves to his notice would fill three
chapters: then the patentees—the literary people who were prepared to
write memoirs, biographies, etc—would have to be omitted.
</p>

<p>
Now here is a singular paradox. If a poor wretched mortal, barely clothed in
rags, his shoes off his feet, starring with hunger, houseless, homeless, who
hath not where to lay his head, asks you for a copper, it means seven
days’ imprisonment as a rogue. If all the clergymen and ministers, the
secretaries, and so forth, come in crowds begging for hundreds and thousands,
it is meritorious, and is applauded.
</p>

<p>
Now this is worthy of study as a phenomenon of society. But these were not all.
Sternhold had another class of applicants, whom we will not call ladies, or
even women, but <i>females</i> (what a hateful word female is), who approached
him pretty much as the Shah was approached by every post while in London and
Paris.
</p>

<p>
He was deluged with photographs of females. Not disreputable characters
either—not of Drury Lane or Haymarket distinction, but of that class who
use the columns of the newspapers to advertise their matrimonial propensities.
Tall, short, dark, light, stout, thin, they poured in upon him by hundreds; all
ready, willing, and waiting.
</p>

<p>
Most were “thoroughly domesticated and musical;” some were
penetrated with the serious responsibilities of the position of a wife; others
were filled with hopes of the life to come (having failed in this).
</p>

<p>
Some men would have enjoyed all this; some would have smiled; others would have
flung the lot into the waste-basket. Sternhold was too methodical and too much
imbued with business habits to take anything as a good joke. He read every
letter, looked at every photograph, numbered and docketed them, and carefully
put them away.
</p>

<p>
Other efforts were made to get at him. He had parasites—men who hung on
him—lickspittles. To a certain extent he yielded to the titillation of
incessant laudation; and, if he did not encourage, did not repel them. They
never ceased to fan his now predominant vanity. They argued that the
Corporation and all the rest were influenced by selfish motives (which was
true). They begged him not to forget what was due to himself—not to
annihilate and obliterate himself. It was true he was aged; but aged
men—especially men who had led temperate lives like
himself—frequently had children. In plain words, they one and all
persuaded him to marry; and they one and all had a petticoated friend who would
just suit him.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold seemed very impassive and immoveable; but the fact was that all this
had stirred him deeply. He began to seriously contemplate marriage. He brooded
over the idea. He was not a sentimental man; he had not even a spark of what is
called human nature in the sense of desiring to see merry children playing
around him. But he looked upon himself as a mighty monarch; and as a mighty
monarch he wished more and more every day to found not only a kingdom, but a
dynasty.
</p>

<p>
This appears to be a weakness from which even the greatest of men are not
exempt. Napoleon the Great could not resist the idea. It is the one sole object
of almost all such men whose history is recorded. Occasionally they succeed;
more often it destroys them. Some say Cromwell had hopes in that direction.
</p>

<p>
So far the parasites, the photographs, the stir that was made about it,
affected Sternhold. But if he was mad, he was mad in his own way. He was not to
be led by the nose; but those who knew him best could see that he was
meditating action.
</p>

<p>
Dodd, the landlord of the hotel, was constantly bothered and worried for his
opinion on the subject. At last, said Dodd, “I think the Corporation have
wasted their money.” And they had.
</p>

<p>
In this unromantic country the human form divine has not that opportunity to
display itself which was graciously afforded to the youth of both sexes in the
classic days of Greece, when the virgins of Sparta, their lovely limbs anointed
with oil, wrestled nude in the arena.
</p>

<p>
The nearest approach to those “good old times” which our modern
prudery admits, is the short skirts and the “tights” of the ballet.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold, deeply pondering, arrived at the notion, true or false, that the
wife for him must possess physical development.
</p>

<p>
This is a delicate subject to dwell on; but I think he was mistaken when he
visited the theatres seeking such a person. He might have found ladies, not
<i>females</i> nor women, but ladies in a rank of life nearer or above his own,
who exulted in the beauty of their form, and were endowed with Nature’s
richest gifts of shape. But he was a child in such a search: his ideas were
rude and primitive to the last degree. At all events, the fact remains.
</p>

<p>
It was found out afterwards that he had visited every theatre in London, but
finally was suited on the boards of a fourth-rate “gaff” in
Stirmingham itself.
</p>

<p>
There was a girl there—or rather a woman, for she was all
five-and-twenty—who was certainly as fine a specimen of <i>female</i>
humanity as ever walked. Tall, but not too tall, she presented a splendid
development of bust, torso, and limbs. Her skin was of that peculiar dusky
hue—not dark, but dusky—which gives the idea of intense vitality.
Her eyes were as coals of fire—large, black, deep-set, under heavy
eyebrows. Her hair at a distance was superb—like night in hue, and
glossy, curling in rich masses. Examined closer it was coarse, like wire. Her
nose was the worse feature; it wanted shape, definition. It was a decided
<i>retroussé</i>, and <i>thick</i>; but in the flush of her brilliant
colour, her really grand carriage, this was passed over. Her lips were scarlet,
and pouted with a tempting impudence.
</p>

<p>
This was the very woman Sternhold sought. She was vitality itself
impersonified. He saw her, offered his hand, and was instantly accepted. He
wished her to keep it quiet; and notwithstanding her feminine triumph she
managed to do so, and not a soul in Stirmingham guessed what was in the wind.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold went to London, got a special licence, and the pair were married in
Sternhold’s private apartments at his hotel in the presence of three
people only, one of whom was the astounded Dodd. They left by the next train
for London, where the bride went to Regent Street to choose her trousseau, with
her husband at her side.
</p>

<p>
Not a bell was rung in Stirmingham. The news spread like wildfire, and
confounded the city. People gathered at the corners of the streets.
</p>

<p>
“He is certainly mad,” they said. Most of them were in some way
disappointed.
</p>

<p>
“He may be,” said a keener one than the rest; “he may
be—but <i>she</i> is not.”
</p>

<h3>Seven.</h3>

<p>
Lucia Marese, now Mrs Sternhold Baskette, was the daughter of an Italian father
and an English mother, and had a tolerably accurate acquaintance with Leicester
Square and Soho. She was not an absolutely bad woman in the coarsest sense of
the term—at least not at that time, she had far too much ambition to
destroy her chance so early in life. Physiologists may here discuss the
question as to whether any latent trace of the old gipsy blood of the Baskettes
had in any way influenced Sternhold in his choice. Ambitious as she was, and
possessed of that species of beauty which always takes with the multitude,
Lucia had hitherto been a failure. Just as in literature and in art, the
greatest genius has to wait till opportunity offers, and often eats its own
heart in the misery of waiting, so she had striven and fought to get to the
front, and yet was still a stroller when Sternhold saw her. She knew that if
only once she could have made her appearance on the London boards, with her
gorgeous beauty fully displayed, and assisted by dress and music, that she
should certainly triumph. But she could not get there.
</p>

<p>
Other girls less favoured by Nature, but more by circumstance, and by the
fickle and unaccountable tastes of certain wealthy individuals, had forestalled
her, and she stored up in her mind bitter hatred of several of these who had
snubbed and sneered at her.
</p>

<p>
The fairy prince of her dream, however, came at last in the person of an old
man of three score years and ten, and she snapped him up in a trice. No doubt,
like all Stirmingham, she entertained the most fabulous ideas of
Sternhold’s wealth.
</p>

<p>
These dreams were destined to be rudely shattered. She seems to have had pretty
much her own way at first. Doubtless the old man was as wax in her hands, till
his former habits began to pull at him. She had one good trait at all events,
if it could be called good—the first use she made of her new position was
to provide for her family, or rather for the only member of it in England.
</p>

<p>
This was Aurelian Marese, her brother, who must have been a man of some talent
and energy, for despite all obstacles of poverty he contrived to pass his
examination and obtain a diploma from the College of Surgeons. He came to
Stirmingham, and with the assistance of Sternhold’s purse set up as a mad
doctor, in plain parlance, or in softer language, established a private lunatic
asylum. Oddly enough, it would seem that notwithstanding the immense population
of the city, there was not till that time any establishment of the kind in the
place, and the result was that Aurelian prospered. He certainly was a clever
fellow, as will be presently seen, though some fancy he over-reached himself.
When at last Sternhold, worn out with the unwonted gaieties into which Lucia
plunged him, showed unmistakable signs of weariness, and desired to return to
Stirmingham, she yielded with a good grace. She reckoned that he could not last
long, and it was her game to keep him in good temper; for she had learnt by
this time that he had the power to dispose of his property just as he chose.
</p>

<p>
We can easily imagine the restlessness of this creature confined in the dull
atmosphere of three or four rooms at Dodd’s Hotel, South Street. But she
bore it, and to her it was a species of martyrdom—the very reverse of
what she had pictured.
</p>

<p>
After a while, as time went on, whispers began to fly about—people
elevated their eyebrows and asked questions under their breath, exchanged nods
and winks. The fact was apparent; Sternhold could scarce contain himself for
joy. There was an undoubted prospect of The Heir. The old man got madder than
ever—that is, in the sense of self-laudation. He could not admire himself
sufficiently. The artful woman played upon him, you may be sure; at all events
there was a deed of gift executed at this time conveying to her certain
valuable estates lying outside the city, and tolerably unencumbered. Why she
came to select those particular estates which were not half so valuable as
others she might have had, was known only to herself then; but doubtless
Aurelian had heard about the Yankee claims, and advised her to take what was
safe. These estates were, in fact, bought with old Romy’s money made by
the nail factory, and were quite apart from the rest.
</p>

<p>
About this time, also, Sternhold left Dodd’s Hotel. This was another
evidence of her power over him. The best joke was, that although there was old
Romy’s country mansion about five miles from Stirmingham, although
Sternhold had since purchased four other mansions, and had nominally street
upon street of houses in the town, he had not a place to take his wife to. He
was obliged to rent one of his own houses of the company who had built it on a
building lease.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Sternhold now had her great wish gratified to some extent. She was the
observed of all observers. They tell you tales now in Stirmingham of her
extravagance, and the lengths she went. Her carriages, her horses, her
servants, her dinners, parties, and what not, were the one topic of
conversation. Even old-fashioned, straitlaced people found their objections
overcome by curiosity, and accepted her invitations.
</p>

<p>
Old Sternhold was never visible at these gatherings; but he rejoiced in them.
He was proud of his wife. He looked upon her as a prodigy. He gave her the
reins. But personally he practically returned to his old habits. He still
retained his old apartments at Dodd’s; and there he might be found, at
almost all hours, sitting at his desk, and eagerly, joyously receiving every
visitor who came to tell him of some fresh extravagance, some fresh frolic of
his wife’s!
</p>

<p>
How was all this expenditure supported, since his actual income was so small?
By a series of loans, which there were always men ready to offer, and whose
terms Sternhold always signed. Once or twice he did remonstrate, but darling
Lucia went into tears, and her brother Aurelian assured him that, in her state
of health, any vexation was dangerous, etc. Aurelian, through the Sternhold
connexion, was now a fashionable physician.
</p>

<p>
At last the event happened, and a son was born. The memory of the week
succeeding that day will not soon pass away in Stirmingham.
</p>

<p>
Old Sternhold, himself a most temperate man, declared that he would make every
one in the city tipsy; and he practically succeeded. He had barrels of ale and
gallons of spirits and wine offered free to all comers at every public-house
and tavern. He had booths erected in an open field just outside the town, for
dancing and other amusements, and here refreshments of all kinds were served
out gratis.
</p>

<p>
The police were in despair. The cells overflowed, and would hold no more, and
the streets reeled with drunken men, and still more drunken women.
</p>

<p>
This saturnalia reigned for four days, and would soon have culminated—at
least, so the police declared—in a general sack of the city by the
congregated ruffians. A detachment of dragoons was actually sent for, and
encamped in Saint George’s Square, with their horses and arms ready at a
moment’s notice. But it all passed off quietly; and from that hour
Sternhold, and more particularly the infant son, became the idol of the
populace.
</p>

<p>
They still look back with regret to those four days of unlimited licence, and
swear by the son of Sternhold.
</p>

<p>
This boy was named John Marese Baskette, but was always called Marese.
Singularly enough, the birth of this child, which one would have prophesied
would have completed the hold Lucia had over the father, was the beginning of
the difficulties between them. It began in his very nursery. Proud of her
handsome figure, and still looking forward to popular triumphs, Lucia flatly
refused to nurse the infant herself.
</p>

<p>
This caused a terrible quarrel. Old Sternhold had old-fashioned ideas. But
there is no need to linger on this. Lucia, of course, had her own way, and
Sternhold retired to sulk at Dodd’s Hotel. From that time the chink
widened, and the mutual distrust strengthened.
</p>

<p>
There never was any real doubt that the boy was legitimate; but some devil
whispered the question in Sternhold’s mind, and, he brooded over it. I
say some devil, but, in actual fact, it was one of those parasites who have
been once or twice alluded to. Is there anything that class will stop at in the
hope of a few formal lines in a rich man’s will?
</p>

<p>
It was their game to destroy Lucia. The plan was cunningly formed. As if by
accident, passages in Lucia’s previous life, when she was a stroller,
were alluded to in Sternhold’s presence.
</p>

<p>
He grew excited, and eager to hear more; to probe her supposed dishonour. The
parasites distinctly refused; it was too serious a matter. Still, if he wished
to hear—it was common talk—all he had to do was to go into the
billiard rooms. Some of the fellows there did not know him by sight, and they
were sure to talk about it.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold went. Of all the sights in the world, to see that old man making a
miserable attempt to play billiards while his ears were acutely listening to
the infamous tales purposely started to inflame him, nothing could be more
deplorable. The upshot was he grew downright mad, but not so mad that anything
could be done with him. He watched over Lucia like a hawk. She could not move;
her life became really burdensome.
</p>

<p>
It must be remembered that at that time she really was, though wild enough in
blood, perfectly stainless in fact. The temper in the woman was long
restrained. In the first place, she wanted his money; in the next place, there
was her son, whom she loved with all the vigour of her nature. She bore it for
a year or two, then the devil in her began to stir.
</p>

<p>
Old Sternhold, who had watched and inquired hour by hour all this time, had
found nothing wrong; but this very fact was turned against her by those devils,
his lickspittles. They represented that this was part of her cunning—that
she had determined he should have no hold upon her, in order that her son might
inherit. They reminded Sternhold that, although he could not divorce her, he
could alter his will. Here they rather overshot the mark, because he began to
reflect that if he cut off his son the old question would arise—To whom
should he leave his city, as he called it?
</p>

<p>
The miserable dilemma haunted and worried his already weakened brain and body
till he grew a shadow, and Lucia had hopes that he would die. But he did not;
in a month or two the natural strength of his constitution brought him round.
</p>

<p>
All this time Lucia was in dread about his will. Aurelian astute and cunning as
he was hardly knew what to advise or how to act. He had his spies—for he
was wealthy now to a certain degree, and could afford it. He had his strong
suspicions that some of the companies who had leased the property for building
had a hand in the persecution of Lucia, and in the inflammation of
Sternhold’s jealousy. It was certainly their interest to get the boy
disinherited. Aurelian began to grow seriously alarmed. Sternhold was stronger
and better—perhaps if he had had Aurelian for physician he would not have
recovered so fast; but with his distrust of Lucia, came an equal distrust of
her brother, and he would not acknowledge him.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian looked at it like this: Sternhold was now about seventy-five, and had
no organic disease. His father, Romy, had lived to a ripe old age; his
grandfather, the basket-maker, though shot in the prime of life, came of a
hardy, half-gipsy stock. The chances were that Sternhold, with all the comforts
that money could buy, would live another ten years. This very worry, this
jealousy, by keeping his mental faculties alive, might contribute to longevity.
In ten years, in a year, in a month, what might not happen?
</p>

<p>
His greatest fear was in Lucia herself, who had shown signs of late that she
must burst forth. If she did, and without his being near her, there was no
knowing what indiscretion she might not commit. It was even suspicious that
Sternhold had recovered. It looked as if he had made up his mind, and had
signed a will averse to Lucia’s interest and his son’s—had
settled it and dismissed it. This was a terrible thought, this last. When he
suggested the possibility of it to Lucia, you should have seen her. She raved;
her features swelled up and grew inflamed; her frame dilated; her blood seemed
as if it would burst the veins: till at last she hissed out, “I’ll
kill him!” and fell fainting.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian determined one point at once. There must be no more delay; action was
the order. But what? Suppose the worst. Suppose the will already made, and
against Lucia’s interests, what was the course to be taken? Why, to
accumulate evidence to invalidate it. <i>Prove him mad</i>!
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Eight.</h3>

<p>
The idea having been once entertained, grew and grew, till it overshadowed
everything else. The singular circumstance then happened of one man slowly and
carefully collecting evidence during another’s lifetime to prove him
insane the moment he died.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian placed his principal reliance upon the violent jealousy Sternhold had
exhibited. So vehement and irregulated a passion founded upon mere phantasms of
the imagination, was in itself strong presumptive proof of an unsound mind. He
had no difficulty in finding witnesses to Sternhold’s outrageous conduct.
The old man had been seen walking up and down the street, on the opposite side
of the pavement to the house in which Lucia lived, for hours and hours at a
time, simply watching. He had been heard to use violent and threatening
language. He had made himself ill. The mind was so overwrought by excitement
that it reacted upon the body, and it was some time before the balance was
restored—if indeed it could ever be restored.
</p>

<p>
There were many trifling little things of manner—of
fidgetiness—absurd personal habits—which, taken in conjunction with
the bad temper he had displayed, went to make up the case. Aurelian added to
this the vanity Sternhold had of late openly indulged in. This was notorious,
and had become a by-word.
</p>

<p>
But when Aurelian had written all this out upon paper—when he had, as it
were, prepared his brief—his shrewd sense told him that in truth it was
very weak evidence. Any lawyer employed for the defence could easily find
arguments to upset the whole.
</p>

<p>
Day by day, as he thought it over, his reliance upon the insanity resource grew
less and less—and yet he could not see what else there was to do. He
racked his brain. The man, like others, was in fact fascinated by the enormous
property at stake: he could not get it out of his mind. It haunted him day and
night. He ransacked his memory, called up all his reading, all his observation,
all that he had heard—every expedient and plan that had come under his
notice for gaining an end.
</p>

<p>
For a time, however, it was in vain. It is often the case that when we seek an
idea it flies from us, and will not be constrained, not even by weeks of the
deeply-pondering state. Often the more we think upon a subject, the less we
seem to see our way clear. And so it was with him.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes a little change of scene, even a little manual exercise, will
stimulate the imagination. So it was with him.
</p>

<p>
He had an important and serious case to attend—a rich patient underwent
an operation at his hands, and the physician grew so absorbed with his delicate
manipulation and in genuine delight in his own skill, that Lucia and the
property passed for a day or two completely out of his memory. This was
followed by profound slumber, and next morning he awoke with the answer to the
great question staring him in the face.
</p>

<p>
If Sternhold was not mad enough now, why not drive him mad? If he was driven
frantic and shut up in an asylum, Lucia’s son would to a certainty
inherit the property. Possibly he (Aurelian) might be appointed
trustee—he, as uncle, would be a guardian, and probably the only one. He
might also have the pleasure of receiving Sternhold into his own retreat for
lunatics; and so, while furthering the interests of his sister and nephew, do
himself a good turn. The idea enraptured him.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian possessed the true scientific mind which is incapable of feeling. Some
thinkers believe that the true artistic mind, the highest artistic mind, is
also incapable of feeling. It is so absorbed in its own realisation of one
idea, that it loses all consciousness of possible suffering in others. He never
doubted for an instant that it was in his power to attain the proposed
object—it was only to <i>let Lucia loose</i>. Let her loose—a
little way. Let her loose under strict supervision—under the constant
surveillance of himself, his son, a youth of twenty whom he was training up in
the right road, and perhaps of other witnesses.
</p>

<p>
There was such a thing as divorce—this might not destroy the
child’s right, but it would place him out of Lucia’s hands. There
must be no handle for Lucia’s enemies to grasp at. She must be manoeuvred
so as to make Sternhold frantic without committing herself.
</p>

<p>
Lucia was aflame for such a course. She had restrained herself for years. She
was burning to be free, on fire for “life” and excitement; above
all, for admiration, for praise—the intoxicating breath of the multitude
that cheers to the echo! The Stage! the dance—music—the fiery gaze
of a thousand eyes following each motion! There must have been something of the
true artist in her. The grandest position, the most unlimited wealth, would not
have satisfied her without the stage.
</p>

<p>
She had married Sternhold in the hope of appearing as other women did in the
theatres owned by their lovers. She had tried to broach the subject to
Sternhold; he had held up his hands in horror, and she constrained herself and
bided her time.
</p>

<p>
Nearly four years now—four years! The coarse jests, the loud laughter,
the shouts and screams and cat-calls of the low threepenny gaff or music hall
from which she had been snatched—even such a life as that seemed to her
far, far superior to this irksome confinement, this slavery which was not even
gilded. Aurelian was right in his conjecture that she could not be much longer
held in—she must burst out.
</p>

<p>
Half-formed schemes had been working themselves into shape in her mind for
months past. She would leave her boy with Aurelian, take her jewels and sables,
sell them, borrow money upon the estate which Sternhold had made hers by deed
of gift, go to London or Paris, and plunge headlong into “life,”
paying any price for the one grand ambition of her existence.
</p>

<p>
The craving—the <i>fury</i>, it might almost be called—the furious
desire for admiration from men which seized upon her at times, would certainly,
sooner or later, have hurled her on to a desperate step.
</p>

<p>
At this moment Aurelian came with his carefully-considered plan. She met him
open-armed. With one blow she could avenge herself upon Sternhold, with one
blow gratify herself and destroy him—destroy him body and soul. This
moment—this hour!
</p>

<p>
But not so fast. First, Aurelian obtained the money—no small sum. Next,
said he, this thing must not be done by halves. It was useless for her to
appear on some small stage; she must at one bound become the talk of all the
town. This required care, thought, and organisation. Those great successes that
seemed so suddenly attained without an effort, as by a wave of the hand, had
really been preceded by months and months of preparation, and depended in great
part upon the matured judgment and clever advice of men who had watched the
public for years.
</p>

<p>
Impatient as she was, Lucia again controlled herself, and did as she was bid.
Aurelian made it his business first to discover where she could appear with
most effect. He soon selected the place, Paris! he obtained an interview with
the proper authorities, and confided to them a part of his secret. They saw
their way to profit, and agreed.
</p>

<p>
The next thing was the character she should take, and the second, the season.
This last the manager, or rather owner, who was in raptures with the thing,
easily decided. It must be at the height of the Paris season. He was a popular
man, who could gather together a mighty crowd of his own acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
If poor Sternhold, sitting in his apartment at Dodd’s Hotel, could have
heard these “fast” young men discussing the approaching appearance
of his wife, Aurelian would have gone no further.
</p>

<p>
The choice of character Aurelian insisted upon deciding, and he chose Lady
Godiva. As has been stated, Lucia had extraordinary hair, both for length and
abundance, and, unlike long hair generally, it was curly. Had it been fine and
delicate hair she could have boasted that few women in Europe could equal her.
The coarseness of its texture would not be visible upon the stage.
</p>

<p>
She had really a magnificent figure. The character of Lady Godiva was one
exactly fitted for her. It is needless to say that there was little or no
acting—no study of parts, no insight into the meaning required, as in the
case of Shakespeare’s heroines. The piece was simply a spectacle devised
to bring out one central figure into the boldest relief.
</p>

<p>
The greatest difficulty the conspirators—for so they may be fairly
called—had to contend with was the necessity of keeping Sternhold
completely in the dark, and yet at the same time getting together a large
audience, which could only be done by advertising. But Aurelian was capable of
dealing with more difficult dilemmas than this. His plan was very simple and
yet effective. The manager had a piece in his <i>répertoire</i> which,
owing to the fame or infamy of a certain fascinating lady, was the rage of the
town. Suddenly this creature disappeared—went off to Vienna with a titled
gentleman—and after blazing as a meteor of the first water there for a
short time, as suddenly dropped out of sight altogether.
</p>

<p>
The manager, at Aurelian’s suggestion, gave out that this lady had turned
up, and was going to again act at his house on a certain night.
</p>

<p>
The excitement was intense. It was an awful falsehood, for the poor girl was in
reality dead. (She met with her death under some strange and suspicious
circumstances, which were, by influence, suppressed.) Her beauty, great as it
was, had lost its charm in the tomb; yet her name, in flaring letters, was
prominent all over Paris.
</p>

<p>
The deception was kept up to the very end; and the company of the theatre, by
dint of double pay, were got to carry it out to perfection. An exceptional
number of waiters were, however, hired, and no one but the manager and Aurelian
had any idea what the object of this troop of apparently idle fellows could be.
</p>

<p>
The house filled to the last seat. The poor dead girl’s name was on every
lip—her frailties were discussed with horrid flippancy; the orchestra
began, and Lucia Marese Baskette robed, or rather unrobed, as Lady Godiva.
</p>

<p>
The owner of the theatre was there, and with him a whole host of men about
town, most of whom were partly in the secret, but not quite.
</p>

<p>
Just before the time arrived for the curtain to rise, this troop of idle
waiters entered the arena, swarmed into the boxes, into the galleries and pit,
distributing to every single individual who had entered a handbill, announcing
that, instead of Miss, “Mrs Sternhold Baskette, the beautiful wife of
Sternhold Baskette, Esq, the richest man in the world, the owner of twenty
millions sterling worth of property, would appear as Lady Godiva; a part for
which her splendid physique and magnificent hair peculiarly fitted her.”
At the same moment a large poster was put out in front of the curtain, bearing
the same announcement.
</p>

<p>
The effect was singular. The house, which had been full of noise before, became
as still as death. People were astounded. They could not believe it possible;
yet, at the same time, they knew that the manager dared not play a trick.
Theatres had been wrecked before now by indignant audiences. They waited in
silence.
</p>

<p>
The curtain rose. I cannot pause to describe the gradual enthusiasm which
arose, nor to draw a picture of the grand <i>tableau</i>. But there are many
living who remember that memorable night, who declare that anything equal to it
has never been seen upon the stage.
</p>

<p>
Lucia rode on a milk-white palfrey, and looked extraordinarily handsome. The
house rose—the audience went mad. Recalled and recalled, again and again
that white palfrey paced to and fro, and the mighty multitude would not allow
the scene to pass.
</p>

<p>
The mesmeric influence of the excitement filled Lucia with a glowing beauty;
with a brilliance which made her seem a goddess—of her order. No one
remarked whether the piece was properly gone through after this. I think it was
not. From all that I can learn, I believe the audience watched Godiva to and
fro till the palfrey or its rider grew exhausted, and then left <i>en
masse</i>.
</p>

<p>
Paris was aflame next day. The papers said nothing—they were wise. There
is, however, something more powerful even than the newspaper—it is
conversation. Lucia had got conversation—her name was heard everywhere.
It was not only the acting, or show—it could not be called
acting—it was the fact of her position as Sternhold’s wife. She
stood upon the pinnacle of his fame for wealth, brazen and shameless in the
eyes of the world. Brazen and shameless, yet secure; for Aurelian never left
her. He watched her himself. His son—his paid servants—did the
same; not from fear of her indiscretion, but in order to appear as witnesses if
any proceedings should take place.
</p>

<p>
Next night and next night, and again on the third night, this extraordinary
spectacle was repeated. The crowds that came to the doors could not be
admitted. But by this time the leading papers had felt the pulse of the
people—not the excitable populace, but the steady <i>people</i>. With one
consent they rushed at the exhibition with lance in rest. Improper was the
softest insinuation. They were undoubtedly right. The moment they took this
tone all the press followed, and before the week was over those who had the
power had prohibited the performance.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Nine.</h3>

<p>
The exhibition was stopped, but the end had been attained—Lucia was
famous. The manager and Aurelian had foreseen the inevitable official veto, and
had prepared for it. They had arranged for her to appear as Cleopatra; it was a
part which could be made to suit her admirably by leaving Shakespeare’s
text out of the question, and studying spectacle instead.
</p>

<p>
It is a singular fact that Sternhold had no idea of what was going on until the
fourth or fifth day. He was told that Lucia had left Stirmingham with her
brother for a short visit to Paris, and paid little or no attention to it. For
the first day or two the papers had been silent. At last the news reached him.
</p>

<p>
What Dodd had previously feared now happened—he was struck down with a
slight attack of paralysis, which affected one side. Some persons said it was a
merciful infliction, as it prevented him from witnessing his wife’s
disgrace with his own eyes. They were wrong. His body was bent, but his mind
was torn with contending and frenzied passions. The sense of outrage—of
outrage upon his dignity—was perhaps the strongest. That after all his
labour and self-denial, after long, long years of slowly building up a property
such as his, which rendered him in his own estimation not one whit inferior to
a king; that he should be insulted, his name dragged in the dirt, his wife a
spectacle for all Paris!
</p>

<p>
Sternhold had the vaguest ideas of stage proprieties and theatrical morality.
He had not a doubt but that Lucia was already an abandoned woman. There were
plenty who urged upon him to commence a suit for divorce, though in reality it
was extremely doubtful whether there were sufficient grounds for anything
beyond a judicial separation.
</p>

<p>
But Sternhold was filled with one consuming desire—to see her with his
own eyes. Whether it was this passion, or whether it was the natural strength
of his constitution, certain it is that in a marvellously short time after the
attack, he had himself conveyed to Paris, and sat, a miserable, haggard,
broken-down old man, in a box at the theatre the same night, watching his wife
upon the stage. He did this night after night. A species of fascination seemed
to carry him there to sit silent, brooding over the utter wreck of his great
schemes.
</p>

<p>
After a while he went suddenly back to Stirmingham without a word, without so
much as seeking an interview with Lucia, or issuing any instructions as to what
was to be done. He went back to his old apartments at Dodd’s Hotel. He
shut himself up, refusing to see even the wretched parasites who had sown the
seed of this mischief. It was an instinctive attempt to return to the old, old
habit, the ancient self-concentration, apart from the world. But it failed. So
soon as ever he began to read his letters, to look into his accounts, every
figure, every transaction reminded him of Lucia and her extravagance; the
follies she had been guilty of, and the no less greater folly he had himself
yielded to in granting her every wish, thereby involving his affairs in the
most hopeless confusion. The attempt failed. He rushed again from his retreat
to seek her. Then he heard that she was in Vienna performing. He got there,
supported by his attendants. Doubtless the physical fatigue of the journey
irritated his nerves; at all events, there seems no doubt that when he reached
Vienna he was for the time absolutely mad.
</p>

<p>
He went to the theatre. He saw Lucia as Godiva, just as she had been seen in
Paris. He was alone in his box. Deliberately he levelled a pistol, resting the
barrel upon the edge of the balustrade. As the incense of praise and adulation
rose up, as the pageant moved to and fro, the deadly weapon was aimed at the
central figure. He fired, and the house was in commotion.
</p>

<p>
Those who know what happens when a full theatre is alarmed and excited will
require no description; those who have not seen it cannot imagine it.
</p>

<p>
A second report, and the curling smoke caused a rush to the box, and the
occupant was found upon the floor, as was thought, dead. Lucia alone was calm
and cool. The bullet had not passed even near her; the distance was great and
the aim unsteady; the ball had struck a screen, and did no injury. She
dismounted and advanced to the footlights, extended her hands, and in a few
words begged the audience to be calm. Speedily they saw her thus, as it were,
in their very arms.
</p>

<p>
The theatre rang with acclamation. If it had been a scene prepared it could not
have succeeded better.
</p>

<p>
There were threats and loud cries of rage against the man who had fired at her.
</p>

<p>
“Do not injure him,” she said, at the top of her full, deep voice;
“he is mad!” For she guessed in a moment who it was.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes the whole thing was understood. Continental people are quick
at comprehending—an old husband, a young wife—bah! An attempt first
at murder, then at suicide—bah! What could he have done better calculated
to put Lucia upon the pedestal of fame?
</p>

<p>
Sternhold was not dead; not even injured. The ball he had fired at himself had
not touched him. He had fallen exhausted. When he became physically conscious,
he was raving mad.
</p>

<p>
There was no doubt about it this time. It was a pitiable sight.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian insisted upon seeing him: even he shuddered. The old man was muttering
gibberish to himself. Half his grey hair was gone, for before he could be
stayed he had dragged it out. His arms and limbs were pinioned, but his body
shook with a trembling convulsive movement. The deed was done.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian braced himself up, and hastened at once to Lucia. He knew he should
have a struggle with her, and hoped that in the conflict he should forget the
sight he had left. He had determined to at once withdraw her from the stage.
The victory was won; there must be no more risk.
</p>

<p>
The conflict between the brother and sister was terrible. She raged, her frame
swelled; she had tasted triumph, and the draught is more intoxicating even than
the taste of blood. She would go on.
</p>

<p>
But he was resolute, and he won. That very day he took her to
England—took is the right word, for it was necessary to use physical
force at times. He got her to her house at Stirmingham, and never left her till
she had grown more composed.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold was in an asylum. Aurelian thought that he would surely die; but he
did not.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian then began to scheme to get him in his own “retreat.”
Possession was nine points of the law. He went to Vienna at once before any one
guessed his object, obtained the proper permit, and in six days deposited the
wretched being in his asylum in the suburbs of Stirmingham. Once there, thought
Aurelian, let them get him out if they can.
</p>

<p>
The fact was soon known; and there was an excitement. The parasites,
disappointed and raging, did their best to inflame the populace. There was a
growl, and the police began to prepare for an attack upon the asylum; but,
after all, the moment any of them reflected, they said, “Why, it’s
all right; the poor fellow is mad. He could not be in better hands.” The
plan of a popular tumult fell through.
</p>

<p>
The parasites next tried the law, but found that Aurelian had been before them:
he had all the proper documents; he could not be touched.
</p>

<p>
Next the companies began to stir. They were uncertain what to do, and whether
it was better for their interests that Sternhold should be in his
brother-in-law’s custody or not.
</p>

<p>
That astute gentleman very soon learnt what was passing in their minds, and he
had a very good conception of what could be effected by powerful combination.
</p>

<p>
He opened negotiations with them. He pointed out to them privately that the
real point at issue was not Sternhold, but the boy—the heir—for no
one doubted the legitimacy. Who was to have the custody of the heir?
</p>

<p>
Clever Aurelian hoped that by making friends with the companies who held the
building leases that there would be no opposition to his holding the
boy—to his guardianship of the estate. He had strong grounds to go upon.
To all intents and purposes he was the nearest relation. If the boy died, and
no son of the phantom brother of Romy turned up, <i>perhaps</i> he might have a
claim to the estate.
</p>

<p>
He gave the companies to understand that if he had the guardianship of the boy
their interests should be most carefully studied.
</p>

<p>
They appeared favourable. The step was taken. The boy remained with his mother;
his mother remained in her house, seeing Aurelian daily, and indeed watched by
his <i>employés</i>.
</p>

<p>
No change took place. Aurelian congratulated himself that all was going on
favourably. The boy, who had little or no idea of the meaning of the word
“father,” was constantly at Aurelian’s residence—the
asylum where his parent was confined—playing with Aurelian’s son,
who was carefully instructed to please him, and indeed was sharp enough already
to require little instruction.
</p>

<p>
Sternhold lingered in his melancholy state. He was no longer
violent—simply dejected. He did not seem able to answer the simplest
question. If asked if he was hungry, he would stare, and say something relating
to his school-days.
</p>

<p>
And this was the man who had built Stirmingham. For five years he remained in
this state, and then suddenly brightened up; and it was thought and
<i>feared</i> that he would recover the use of his faculties. It lasted but
three days. In that short time he wrote three important documents.
</p>

<p>
The first was a statement to the effect that he had wronged Lucia. He now saw
his folly—he had been led into his persecution of her by designing
people, and blamed himself for his subsequent conduct. He earnestly entreated
her forgiveness. The second was a species of family history, short but
complete, refuting the claims of the American Baskettes. They were indeed of
the same name, he wrote, but not of the same blood. The truth was that the
cotters who had lived in the Swamp, now covered with mansions, had no name.
They were half gipsies; they had no registered or baptismal name.
</p>

<p>
Will Baskette, who had been shot, was the chief man among them, and gradually
they came by the country people to be called by his name. They were not blood
relations in any sense of the term. This paper also gave the writer’s
views of his transactions with the Sibbolds and the cotters or
“Baskettes,” and concluded with the firmly expressed
conviction—the honest statement of a man near his end—that his
title was irrefutable, and he knew of no genuine claim.
</p>

<p>
The third document was his Will. For now it appeared that hitherto he had never
made a will at all. It was extremely short, but terse and unmistakable. It left
the whole of his property, real and personal (with the single exception of the
gift to Lucia), to his son, John Marese Baskette.
</p>

<p>
The will Aurelian took care was properly attested, and by independent witnesses
whom he sent for.
</p>

<p>
On the fourth day old Sternhold died, quietly and without a word. He was
buried, and hardly was he in the tomb before the battle began. The companies at
once cut off all connection with Aurelian. They had reckoned upon his managing
to get their terms at all events extended, as he had promised. The Corporation
refused any honours to the dead king, and all eagerly sought about for the
means of dividing the spoil.
</p>

<p>
After all their consultations, not all the subtlety of twenty solicitors could
suggest any feasible plan—the old man had baffled them at last. It was
useless to plead that he was insane, and actually in an asylum at the moment of
executing the will. What was the good even if such a plea was
successful—if the will was upset, the property would descend to the boy
just the same. There seemed no way of getting at it.
</p>

<p>
But at last a weak point was found. It was a time when a great deal of
commotion was made about the Roman Catholic question and the religious
education of minors. Now Lucia was certainly half a foreigner, and it was
believed she was a Catholic. Aurelian was certainly a Catholic. With all his
cunning he had not foreseen this, and he had allowed himself to become a
somewhat prominent member of the Catholic community in Stirmingham. He had no
religion, but it paid him. Catholics are rich people, and when rich people go
insane they are profitable. So he was caught in his own trap.
</p>

<p>
There was an agitation got up among the ultra-Protestant community. Funds were
started to release the heir from the clasp of Rome. The companies, the
Corporation, all joined in the outcry. The question was made a national one by
the newspapers. But there was one difficulty: the law required that there
should be a person to sue. After much trouble this person was selected in one
of the Baskettes of American origin, who had settled in Stirmingham, and
claimed to be a nearer relation than Aurelian.
</p>

<p>
The battle was long and furious, and cost heavy sums. No expense was spared on
either side, and the estate got still further encumbered. It promised to be a
drawn battle; but at last, having passed all the tribunals, it began to
approach the place of power, and to be discussed in the Ministerial Cabinet.
There was a man there who desired to obtain the Catholic vote of Ireland, and
the Aurelian party began to boast already of success. But this very boasting
spoilt their game. The Ministry lost the confidence of the people, the House
followed suit, a new Ministry came into place, and the final decision was
against the Catholic, or, as they termed themselves, legitimate party—for
they said the uncle and the mother were the legitimate guardians.
</p>

<p>
The result was in truth disappointing to all the parties. The boy was made a
ward of Chancery, proper receivers of the estate were appointed, and the
companies who had begun to exult were entrapped. The lad was taken from his
mother and uncle, and sent to Eton to prepare for college.
</p>

<p>
Thus a new element of complexity was added to the already chaotic state of this
vast estate.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Ten.</h3>

<p>
If ever there was a life that illustrated the oft-quoted phrase “poor
humanity,” it was that of Sternhold Baskette. But this is not the place
to moralise—we must hasten on. The orchestra has nearly finished the
overture; the play will soon begin.
</p>

<p>
Lucia had now no longer any reason for restraint. Her boy was safe—safe
as the laws of a great country could make him—certain to inherit a
property which by the time he was forty would be of value surpassing
calculation. She rejoiced in it, gloried in it. To her it was more welcome than
the confirmed guardianship of Aurelian would have been, because it left her
free.
</p>

<p>
The lad was at Eton, and happy—far happier than he could have been
elsewhere. His mother immediately commenced a course which led her by a rapid
descent to the lowest degradation.
</p>

<p>
She returned to Paris. Aurelian felt it was useless now to interfere, neither
could he afford more expense.
</p>

<p>
She easily got upon the stage again, and became more popular than ever. At the
age of forty she was even more handsome than in her youth. Her features had
been refined by the passage of time and by the restraint to which she had been
subjected. Her form was more fully developed.
</p>

<p>
It is unpleasant to linger on this woman’s disgrace. She formed a
<i>liaison</i> with a rich foreign gentleman, retired with him from Paris after
a time, and the <i>Stirmingham Daily Post</i>, which pursued the Baskettes with
unmitigated hatred year after year, did not fail to chronicle the birth of a
son.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian, baffled, was not beaten. He was a resolute and patient man. Like the
famous Carthaginian father, he brought up his son and educated him to consider
the Baskette estates as the one object of his attention—only in this case
it was not for destruction, but for preservation.
</p>

<p>
When young John Marese Baskette, the heir, after distinguishing himself at
Eton, was sent higher up the Thames to Oxford, Aurelian immediately placed his
son, Theodore Marese, at the same college.
</p>

<p>
The result was exactly as he had foreseen. The heir formed a bond of
friendship—such as it is in these days—with Theodore. Their one
topic of conversation was the estate.
</p>

<p>
John was full of the most romantic notions. He was in youth a really exemplary
lad—clever, hard-working, winning to himself the good will of all men.
Theodore had a genuine liking for his cousin—then, at all events, though
probably in after life the attachment he professed was chiefly caused by self
interest.
</p>

<p>
John was full of ambitious dreams. His vivid imagination had been worked upon
by the talk among his companions about the famous owner of twenty millions
sterling—his father. Upon an old bookstall he obtained a copy of
“The Life of Sternhold Baskette,” now out of print. It inflamed him
to the uttermost. There was good metal in the boy if he had only had friends
and parents to put it to proper use. He formed the most extraordinary schemes
as to what he would do with this wealth when he became of age, and stepped at
one bound into the full enjoyment of it, as he supposed he should.
</p>

<p>
It was all to be used for the alleviation of the misery of the world, for the
relief of the poor, for the succouring of the afflicted, the advancement of all
means that could mitigate the penalties attaching to human existence.
</p>

<p>
As time wore on, however, these benevolent intentions received their first
check.
</p>

<p>
He reached his twenty-first birthday. He claimed his birthright, and was
refused. Briefly, the reason was because the companies and the American
claimants had entered pleas, and because also the property was terribly
encumbered, and would require long years of nursing yet before it could be
cleared, and this nursing the higher Courts insisted upon.
</p>

<p>
Instead of the magnificent income he expected, the young man received two
thousand pounds per annum only. It struck his nature a heavy blow, and did much
to pervert it, for he looked upon it in the sense of a shameful injustice. With
Theodore he left college; at all events he was now his own master, and entered
“life.”
</p>

<p>
Every one knows what “life” is to a young man of twenty-one with
two thousand a year certain—the power of borrowing to a wide margin, and
no monitor to check and retard the inevitable course.
</p>

<p>
Theodore was much older—fully thirty at this time; but he was as eager
for enjoyment, and perhaps more so.
</p>

<p>
To make the story short, they ran through every species of
extravagance—visited Paris, Vienna, and all the continental centres of
dissipation.
</p>

<p>
Ten whole years passed away. John Marese Baskette was by this time a thorough
man of the world, deeply in debt, brilliant and fascinating in manner, false
and selfish to the backbone. He inherited his mother’s beauty. A tall,
broad, well-made man, dark curling hair, large dark eyes, and large eyelashes,
bronzed complexion, which, when he was excited, glowed with almost womanly
brilliance; strong as a lion, gentle in manner, and fierce as a tiger under the
velvet glove. Polished and plausible, there were those who deemed him shallow
and wholly concerned with the pleasure of the hour; but they were mistaken.
</p>

<p>
John Marese Baskette had rubbed off all the soft and good aspirations of his
boyhood; but the ambition which was at the bottom of those schemes remained,
and had intensified tenfold. He was burning with ambition. The hereditary mind
of the Baskettes, their brain power, had descended to him in full vigour
(though hitherto he had wasted it), and he also inherited their thirst for
wealth. But his idea of obtaining it was totally opposed to the family
tradition. The family tradition was a private life devoted with the patience
and self-denial of a martyr to the accumulation of gold.
</p>

<p>
Marese’s one absorbing idea was power. To be a ruler, a statesman, a
leader, was his one consuming desire. As a ruler he thought, as a member of the
Cabinet, it would be easy for him to affect the market in his favour, for
Marese was a gambler already upon a gigantic scale. The Stock Exchange and the
Bourse were his arena.
</p>

<p>
The intense vanity of the man, which led him to seriously hope even for the
English Premiership, was, doubtless, a <i>trait</i> derived from his mother.
“If I had my rights,” he was accustomed to say to Theodore,
“I should be not only the wealthiest man in England, but in Europe and
America. My father’s property has more than doubled in value. In England
the wealthiest man at once takes a position above crowds of clever people who
have nothing but their talents. Without any conceit, I can safely say that I am
clever. A clever, wealthy man is so great a rarity that my elevation is a
certainty. But nothing can be done without money. At present my wealth is a
shadow only. The one thing, Theodore, is money. Our Stock Exchange labour is,
in a sense, wasted; our operations are not large enough. What we make is barely
sufficient to provide us with common luxuries (he did not pretend to say
necessities) and to keep our creditors quiet. Nothing remains for bolder
actions. I am thirty, and I have not yet entered the House.”
</p>

<p>
This last remark was always the conclusion of his reflections. In a sense, it
was like Caesar lamenting upon seeing a statue of Alexander—that he had
done nothing at an age when Alexander had conquered the world. He had not even
the means to fight the enemies who withheld his birthright from him. The
bitterness engendered of these wrongs, the constant brooding over the career
that was lost to him, obscured what little moral sense had been left in him
after the course of life he had been through; and the once gentle boy was now
ripe for any guilt. The verse so often upon the lips of the tyrant was for ever
in his mind, and perpetually escaped him unconsciously—
</p>

<p class="poem">
Be just, unless a kingdom tempt to break the laws,<br />
For sovereign power alone can justify the cause.
</p>

<p>
Like his father Sternhold, he looked upon the undisputed possession of such an
estate as conferring powers and position nothing inferior to that of a monarch.
His dislike to all things American—in consequence of the claims, now more
loudly proclaimed than ever, of the Baskettes from the States—grew to be
almost a monomania. He wished that the United States people had but one neck,
that he might destroy them all at once—applying the Roman emperor’s
saying to his own affairs.
</p>

<p>
His especially favourite study was “The Prince” of Machiavelli,
which he always carried with him. His copy was annotated with a scheme for
applying the instructions therein given to modern times—the outline of
the original requiring much modification to suit the changes in the
constitution of society. Some day he hoped to utilise the labours of the man
whose name has become the familiar soubriquet of the Devil.
</p>

<p>
Theodore, whom Aurelian had made qualify as a surgeon, was imbued with an
inherited taste for recondite research. He would return from a wild scene of
debauchery at early dawn, and drawing the curtains and lighting his lamp to
exclude daylight, plunge into the devious paths of forbidden science. Keen and
shrewd as he was, he did not disdain even alchemy, bringing to the crude ideas
of the ancients all the knowledge of the moderns. Cruel by nature, he excelled
in the manipulation of the dissecting knife, and in the cities upon the
Continent where their wanderings led them, lost no opportunity of practising
with the resident medical men, or of studying those wonderful museums which are
concealed in certain places abroad. Marese was the fiery charger, ready to dash
at every obstacle Theodore was the charioteer—the head which guided and
suggested. Yet all their concentrated thought could not devise a method by
which Marese might obtain the full enjoyment of his estate. Briefly, this was
the condition of Marese’s mind and his position, when the death of
Aurelian took place, and a letter reached them written by him in his last
hours, entreating their return to Stirmingham for reasons connected with the
estate. They went, and a woman went with them as far as London—a woman
whom we must meet hereafter, but who shall be avoided as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
They arrived at Stirmingham unannounced, and examined the papers which the
deceased had particularly recommended to their study. Aurelian, as has been
said, was baffled but not beaten. The fascination of the vast estate held his
mind, as it held so many others, in an iron vice. The whole of his life was
devoted to it. He had searched and searched back into the past, groping from
point to point, and he had accumulated such a mass of evidence as had never
been suspected.
</p>

<p>
He knew far more even than poor Sternhold, who had occupied himself exclusively
with the future.
</p>

<p>
Marese and Theodore, living quietly in the residence attached to the asylum for
the insane, which Aurelian had continued to keep, carefully studied these
papers by the light of the lucid commentary the dead man had left. It is
needless to recount the whole of the contents—most of them are known
already to the reader. But the substance of it all was that three great dangers
menaced the estate. The first was the claims of the Baskettes from America.
</p>

<p>
The evidence which Aurelian had collected was clear that the land they had
occupied in the Swamp had been practically theirs, since they had paid no rent;
but as to their power of handing it over to Sternhold, it was extremely
questionable. The second great danger was the claim of a new tribe that had
recently started up—the descendants of James Sibbold, who had also
expatriated themselves.
</p>

<p>
It was doubtful if the transfer made by their ancestors could be maintained,
and for this simple reason—it was doubtful whether James Sibbold himself
had any right to the property his sons sold to Sternhold. He was not the eldest
son. The eldest son, Arthur, had disappeared for a number of years; but there
was not the slightest proof that he had died childless. Far from it. Aurelian,
incessantly searching, had found out what no one else yet knew—that
Arthur had married, had had children, and that one at least of his descendants
was living but a short time since.
</p>

<p>
When Marese had read thus far his countenance turned livid, and Theodore feared
he would have fallen in a fit. The savage passions inherited from his mother
surged up in his frame, and overmastered him. He was ill for days, almost
unconscious—the shock was so great, his passion so fierce—but
presently recovering, read on.
</p>

<p>
Aurelian had traced Arthur in his wanderings, had traced his marriage—but
there was one loophole. Do what he might, Aurelian could not discover
<i>where</i> Arthur had married. It was in London, but a minute search failed
to discover the church, and the register could not be found.
</p>

<p>
This fact, and the fact of the long silence, the absence of any claim being put
forward, led Aurelian to believe that there really was no legal
marriage—that it was only reputed. He hoped as much, at all events.
</p>

<p>
There was another loophole—the deed which old Sibbold had so treasured in
his padlocked oaken chest—the deed which settled the inheritance (on the
female as well as the male)—had disappeared. Sternhold had searched for
it and failed. It was lost. If the marriage could not be proved, and if the
deed was really lost, then there was no danger from Arthur Sibbold’s
descendants; but there remained those “ifs.” Also, if
Arthur’s claim was put aside, then the succession would of course belong
to his brother James Sibbold’s descendants: but then again came in the
question—Could these Sibbolds sign away (to Sternhold) an inheritance
which at the time was <i>entailed</i>?
</p>

<p>
Aurelian finished with several hints and schemes which need not be gone into
here, and indeed were never carried out. But his one great point throughout was
a warning against the living descendant of Arthur Sibbold, whose name and
present address he had discovered and left for Marese, and against the
companies who held the leases. “For,” said he, “these
companies would foster any and every claim against the estate; anything to bar
the succession of Marese, the heir, in order to obtain a grant or extension of
time from the courts of law, to enable them to hold the property till the
succession to the estate was established.” These companies were so rich
and powerful that it was difficult to contend against them. Their strength was
money, their weapons were the various claimants.
</p>

<p>
“Therefore,” wrote Aurelian, “the first thing is money, and I
wish my property to be used freely for this end, convinced that you will do
Theodore full justice; and I bid you, if possible, to take the <i>weapons</i>
of the companies out of their hands. Without the claimants they are
powerless.”
</p>

<p>
These papers, and the facts and reflections they contained, made the deepest
impression upon Marese and Theodore. In secret they walked through the city of
Stirmingham, and marked its wealth, its vastness, its trade and population.
</p>

<p>
“And nearly all this is mine,” whispered Marese, pale as death in
his subdued excitement. He had to hold Theodore’s arm to sustain his
body, for, strong as he was, he trembled.
</p>

<p>
Next day they left for London, for Marese could not bear the Tantalus-like view
of the wealth which was and was not his. In London they thought and planned as
only such men seeking such an end can think and plan.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Eleven.</h3>

<p>
While Marese and Theodore are maturing their plans, it will conduce to the
easier comprehension of the horrible, complicated events which followed, if the
past history of the estate be briefly summed up in such a manner that this
chapter can be used for reference.
</p>

<p>
In the commencement, nearly a century previous to the present time, we have
seen old Sibbold, the morose miser, gloating over his money, and studying his
title-deeds. These gave him an unquestioned right to the farm he occupied, and
to the Swamp, or waste land, which had been squatted on by Will Baskette and
his companions. This right mainly depended, though not entirely, upon a certain
deed of entail. Without that deed Sibbold had still sufficient evidence to
prove his right to his farm, but not to the Swamp; without that deed there was
no fixed succession—that is to say, he could have devised it to any one
he chose.
</p>

<p>
There was, therefore, just the possibility that, hating his eldest son Arthur,
he had himself destroyed this deed, in order to prepare the way for his second
son, James. But against this supposition there was the known character of the
man, which led one to imagine that he would rather have died than give up the
smallest fraction of his possessions. At all events, this deed was missing, as
were several others of little or no value, such as expired leases of fields to
tenants, which had once been kept in Sibbold’s oaken press, under padlock
and key.
</p>

<p>
When Sibbold met with his death at the hands of highwaymen, the farm and waste
lands, in the natural course of things, would have passed to his eldest son,
Arthur, but he having disappeared, and not appearing to make a claim, James
Sibbold, the younger son, took the property. The majority of people always
thought, from the fact of Arthur’s not returning to claim his birthright,
that he had had a hand in the slaughter of old Will Baskette, and that his
conscience drove him away.
</p>

<p>
James Sibbold, after a while, married, and had several sons. In time he died,
and these sons, though married, still all remained living on the farmstead, or
in the outhouses; for as it was known that James’ right was doubtful,
they could not agree about the succession, and preferred to live like pigs
rather than go to law and have it settled, since the result was so uncertain.
At the same time the squatters, basket-makers, reed-cutters, clothes-peg
makers, etc, who resided in the Swamp which the rat had caused, had
considerably increased in numbers, and were always called, after their former
chief, by the name of Baskette.
</p>

<p>
This chief at the date of his death had two sons. The eldest went off with his
mother, and joined the original gipsy tribe; the youngest, whose name or
nickname was Romy, entered the service of the clergyman. The eldest was never
heard of more; but Romy prospered, and in early middle age bought an estate and
country mansion, not far from his birthplace.
</p>

<p>
It was he who opened up the concealed mineral wealth of coal and iron, and
thus, as everything goes by contradiction in this world, it happened that the
descendant of gipsies, notorious for their wandering habits and dislike of
houses, was the founder of one of the largest cities in the world.
</p>

<p>
He married with every legal formality, and his son, Sternhold Baskette, imbued
with the firmest convictions that in the future the young city would prosper to
an unprecedented extent, employed the whole of the wealth he inherited in
purchasing land and erecting houses.
</p>

<p>
In the course of his transactions he desired to purchase the Wick Farm, where
old Sibbold had dwelt, and the Swamp where the Baskette tribe flourished.
Finding the title of the vendors imperfect, he devised the strongest safeguard
he could think of, which was to make all the Sibbolds then living or known, to
sign one document, and all the reputed Baskettes to sign another. He then
transhipped them all to America—first, to get complete possession;
secondly, in the hope that they would never return to trouble him.
</p>

<p>
He proceeded to drain the Swamp, and to convert it into the Belgravia of
Stirmingham. But this project required an enormous expenditure, and just at
that moment the first railway to the place, which he had largely supported,
came to a standstill, and ate up all his available capital. When, therefore, a
return of commercial prosperity took place, he found it impossible alone to
complete the vast scheme of streets, squares, etc, which had been commenced.
</p>

<p>
Then the building lease plan was resorted to—the very keystone of all
this curious history. First, the Corporation of the city took a large slice of
the uncompleted property of him on a building lease for a term of years, on the
expiration of which the whole reverted to him or his heirs (practically his
heirs, as he was not likely to live to the age of 120 years).
</p>

<p>
After they had commenced building some uncertainty arose as to whether or no
they had the power to enter into such an agreement; they could bind themselves,
but could they bind their successors in office? This took place, it must be
remembered, long, long before the recent sanitary legislation, which gives such
extensive powers to local bodies.
</p>

<p>
In order to confirm their proceedings they obtained a private Act of
Parliament, which, when it was drawn up, seemed to be worded clearly enough.
But every one knows that after the lapse of thirty years or less, words in an
inexplicable manner seem to lose their meaning, and to become capable of more
than one interpretation. This is perhaps because the persons who read them are
influenced unconsciously by a series of circumstances which did not exist at
the time the document was composed.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, at the date when Marese and Theodore were thinking and scheming,
there had already been a great deal of contention over the precise scope of
several sentences in this Act: a part of which arose over the question of
repairs to the buildings, and partly as to whether, by a little straining, the
seventy years of the lease might not be construed to mean practically for ever.
</p>

<p>
This little straining was managed in this way. When did the lease commence? Had
not each successive Mayor got the right to say, “This lease, as
interpreted by the Private Act, means, not seventy years from the days of my
predecessor, but seventy years from the commencement of my term of
office.” By this way of looking at it, so long as there was a Mayor the
Corporation would always have seventy years to look forward to.
</p>

<p>
Of course all such reasoning was nothing but pure sophistry; but then most law
is sophistry, and sophistry when supported by a rich body of men and called
Vested Interest, is often much stronger than the highly belauded and really
feeble truth.
</p>

<p>
Here was a tough Gordian knot, to add to the already difficult question of
original title. But this was only the preface to the complications to follow.
There still remained, after the Corporation had taken a part, a huge howling
wilderness of streets with walls two feet high. Companies or syndicates were
formed (eight companies in all)—perhaps they had better be called in
modern parlance building societies—who took this howling wilderness on
the same system of building leases, to fall in at a certain date.
</p>

<p>
Apparently in this case it was all plain, straightforward sailing; but not so.
Sternhold Baskette got into difficulties over Railway Number 2, and had to
borrow money. He also had to borrow money to complete portions of the estate
which he had kept in his own hands, and to acquire lands just outside the city.
Lastly, he had to borrow money to support the extravagance of his wife. In the
aggregate these sums were something enormous.
</p>

<p>
At the moment of borrowing he was under the impression that he had dealt with
independent persons—with financiers, in fact, of London, being so assured
by his solicitors. These solicitors had had a pretty picking out of his
railways and estates; they had grown fat and prosperous upon him, and might,
one would have thought, have been trusted to serve him honestly.
</p>

<p>
But no—whenever was there a friendship formed in business? Ostensibly,
the financiers who advanced the cash were independent; in reality, they acted
for certain of these very aforesaid building societies who had taken the
building leases! Four at least of them had their money thus out upon good
security; and Sternhold, unknowingly at first, owed them a large fortune.
</p>

<p>
For their own interest they had proved easy creditors. They had not called in
the loans; not a fraction of the original sums borrowed from them to complete
Railway Number 2, to finish houses, buy fresh lands, to pay for Lucia’s
extravagance, had been repaid. Very little of the interest had been cleared
off; none while Sternhold lived. They knew that they were safe. The railway was
now paying a fair dividend, the houses and lands had trebled in value; as for
Lucia’s waste it was small in comparison—when they chose to call in
their money they could seize upon property to twice the amount due, even with
added interest.
</p>

<p>
But they did not choose to call in their money. The leases were now approaching
the day of expiration. They knew that the trustees of Sternhold’s estate
had not one tithe of the cash required to meet their demands: they would be
compelled to submit to one of two things—first, they must yield up a good
part of the estate, or they must grant an extension of the leases—either
of which would suit the societies exactly.
</p>

<p>
They intended to push matters in such a way as to compel the trustees to extend
the term, in order to retain both halves, as it were, of the estate under their
control. This was Gordian knot Number 3. How was the heir to come by his own
through all this? It was impossible, unless he could scrape together sufficient
money to pay off the loans which had been contracted by his father. He would
then be in a position to claim the property held by the trustees at the
expiration of the leases, which was now fast approaching.
</p>

<p>
The other four companies had got wind of this nice little arrangement, and it
upset them extremely. They had not been half so shrewd as their fellows, and
that was a bitter reflection. They foresaw their valuable properties passing
away from them, while the other societies held fast to their share. It was gall
and wormwood.
</p>

<p>
But they were not to be outdone in the Art of Entanglement. Sternhold was dead;
they could not lend him money. But the heir, our friend Marese, was living, and
living “fast;” and not only that, he was speculating heavily upon
the Stock Exchange. Here was a fine opening. With careful and judicious
management they bought up all Marese’s debts; they lent him money to a
large amount through their agents, keeping themselves in the background out of
sight; and they had gentlemen always on the watch on the Exchange, whose
business it was to tempt Marese into apparently good bargains with floating
paper.
</p>

<p>
Not content with this, they had still further secured themselves. They had
allied themselves with a certain powerful and enterprising railway company.
This company had hitherto been shut out of Stirmingham, and were extremely
desirous of getting access to it. These second four societies combined, and
declared that in the interests of the properties committed to their charge
(save the mark!) it was essential that there should be more direct railway
communication with a certain district which it is immaterial to name, and that
there should be a station close to their portion of the estate, the other
stations being at some distance. The enterprising railway company would
guarantee good terms if the trustees of the estate would enter into agreement
with them.
</p>

<p>
The upshot was that another Act of Parliament was obtained by the influence of
the said powerful railway company, authorising this line, station, and
agreement. It was now argued that this Act and agreement would override the
original building leases; especially as the railway company were prepared to
prove that they had not yet reaped any reasonable benefit, and, unless the
leases were extended, would be serious losers. As they had immense interest in
the House, they were likely enough to gain their point. Here were two more
Gordian knots, Numbers 4 and 5!
</p>

<p>
Then there was the list of claimants to the estate, which had now been swelled
from all parts of the world, and the series of suits and pleas, and Heaven
knows what other litigation threatened by them, making Gordian knot Number 6.
Finally, the estate was in Chancery. Knot Number 7.
</p>

<p>
Here was a pleasant prospect for the heir! To put all the rest on one side, on
the day that the building leases expired, and he stepped forward to claim his
rights, the building societies would present him with the following neat little
bill:—
</p>

<img src="images/world179.jpg" alt="" />

<p>
“After all,” said Marese to Theodore, as they planned and schemed,
and smoked cigars at 120 shillings the hundred, “after all, old fellow,
this is but one year’s income if I could only get possession. And I
believe we could finance the thing and raise the money without difficulty, if
it were not for those cursed, hateful claimants from America and elsewhere. The
Jews fight shy on account of the title difficulty. If we could but get rid of
those claimants!”
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Twelve.</h3>

<p>
There was once a very wise man who invented what was considered a saying almost
inspired, which was afterwards inculcated as a most important lesson by mighty
princes upon their sons, and continues to be constantly quoted in our day with
approval—it is, that “Unity is strength.” But the strength of
the claimants to the Baskette estate consisted in the number of their scattered
forces.
</p>

<p>
All that Marese, the heir, could have desired was that by some means they could
be condensed into one person, and thus destroyed at a blow. They had increased
as the years went by in a geometrical ratio, till the total formed a small
battalion.
</p>

<p>
When the idea of making claims upon the estate first arose in America, there
were already quite fifty families who in one way or another thought they had
“rights.” About a dozen visited Stirmingham, and all but drove poor
old Sternhold frantic. That was a generation ago, and the tribe had nearly
trebled. Mothers of children who had the remotest possible chance of a share in
the prize took care to have them christened Baskette or Sternhold. There were
Sternhold Baskette Browns, Baskette Johnsons, Baskette Stirmingham Slicks,
English Baskette Williamsons, and every possible combination of Baskette.
</p>

<p>
Those who, either by the male or female side, really could show some species of
proof that they were descended from the seventeen squatters who were
transhipped to the States now numbered no less than one hundred and forty-three
individuals—men, women, and children. To distinguish themselves from
other claimants, they called themselves “The True Swampers.”
</p>

<p>
But in addition to these, there was a host of other Baskettes, who in one way
or another foisted in their names. There were Baskets, Bascots, Buscots,
Biscuits, Buschcotts, Bosquettes—every conceivable variation of spelling
from every State and territory, who declared that they were related to the
parent stem of Will Baskette, the squatter, who was shot by old Sibbold. These
might be called for distinction the pseudo-Baskettes.
</p>

<p>
Then among the True Swampers there was an inner circle, who professed to have
prominent “rights” on account of their progenitors having been more
nearly related to the original Will Baskette. They argued that the others were
not true Baskettes, and had only adopted that name from the chief, while they
were real blood Baskettes.
</p>

<p>
In addition, there was another host of people who made a virtue of proclaiming
that they were not named Baskette. They did not profess to be named
Baskette—they did not take a name which was not theirs! They were
Washingtons, Curries, Bolters, Gregorys, Jamesons, and so on. But they had
claims because their father’s wives were of the Baskette blood.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there was another sub-division who loudly maintained that half of the
original cotters who landed in New York were not Baskettes, but Gibbs, Webbes,
Colborns, and so on, and that they were the descendants of these people. And
there were some who went the length of declaring that they were descended from
two alleged illegitimate sons of old Romy Baskette!
</p>

<p>
The Baskette Battalion was therefore made up of—1st. The Pure Blood
Baskettes; 2nd. The True Swampers; 3rd. Demi-Baskettes, who had that name added
to another; 4th. Nominal Baskettes, whose names had an accidental resemblance;
5th. The Feminine Baskettes, descended from women of Baskette strain; 6th.
Independent Squatters, not Baskettes, but companions; 7th. Illegitimate
Baskettes!
</p>

<p>
Then there were the Sibbolds—such a catalogue! These had been slower to
wake up to their “rights” than the Baskettes, but when they did
discover them they came in crowds. First, there were the descendants, in a
straight line, of the eight sons of James Sibbold, shipped (six with families)
to New York. They had multiplied exceedingly, and there was no end to them. The
simply Sibbolds, as we may call them, numbered no less than two hundred and
eighteen, all told—men, women, and children. Every one of these had some
register, some old book—many of these books were worm-eaten copies of Tom
Paine’s “Rights of Man”—some piece of paper or other to
prove that they had the blood of James Sibbold in their veins.
</p>

<p>
Then there were all the ramifications, pretty much like the Baskette branches;
innumerable cadets distantly related, innumerable people whose wife’s
uncle’s mother or cousin’s name was Sibbold; and all the various
Sibbolde, Sibboldes, Sibald, Sigbeld, Sybels, Sibils, Sibelus, Sibilsons, <i>ad
libitum</i>. Illegitimate Sibbolds were as plentiful as blackberries, and all
ready to argue the merits of the case with revolver and bowie. If the Baskettes
made up a battalion, the Sibbolds formed an army!
</p>

<p>
Between these two great divisions there was the bitterest enmity. The Baskettes
derided the claims of the Sibbolds; the Sibbolds derided those of the
Baskettes. The Sibbolds told the Baskettes that they were an ill-conditioned
lot; if they had been respectable people, and really his relations, old
Sternhold would never have shipped them to America out of his sight. The
Baskettes retorted that the Sibbolds were ashamed to stay in England, for they
were the sons of a murderer; they were the descendants of a dastardly coward,
who shot a man through a window. The Sibbolds snarled, and pointed out that the
great chief of the Baskettes was nothing but a thief, caught in the act and
deservedly punished; a lot of semi-gipsies, rogues, and vagabonds. Their very
name showed that they were but basket-makers; they were not even pure gipsy
blood—miserable squatters on another man’s property.
</p>

<p>
Blows were not unfrequently exchanged in the saloons and drinking-stores over
these quarrels. The result was the formation of two distinct societies, each
determined to prosecute its own claim and to oust the other at all hazards. The
Baskette battalion relied upon the admitted non-payment of rent by their
forefathers to upset all subsequent agreements, and they agreed also that this
agreement which their forefathers had signed was not binding on the remote
descendants. The document was obtained by trickery, and the land was not put to
the use the vendors had understood it was to be put, as the representatives now
alleged, to simple agricultural purposes. Further, each of those who signed the
document only gave up his cottage and the small plot of garden round it; they
did not sell the waste land between the islands.
</p>

<p>
The Sibbolds principal argument was that their forefathers could not sign away
an entailed estate without previously cutting off the entail, and it was
acknowledged that this had not been done. But, said the Baskettes, there was a
question if the land ever was entailed; let the Sibbolds produce the deed, and
if it was not entailed, where was their claim?
</p>

<p>
Each of these divisions formed itself into a society, with a regular committee
and place of meeting, a minute-book to record accumulated evidence, legal
gentlemen to advise, corresponding secretaries, and Heaven knows what. They
actually issued gazettes—printed sheets of intelligence. There was the
<i>Baskette Gazette</i> and the <i>Sibbold Gazette</i>, which papers carefully
recorded all deaths, marriages, and new claims. There was a complete
organisation, and a—fine thing it was for the lawyers and some few sharp
young men.
</p>

<p>
Of late these societies had received more or less cordial overtures from the
eight building societies at Stirmingham who held the leases. The first four
societies encouraged the Baskette battalion, the second held out hopes to the
Sibbolds. The cunning building societies, without committing themselves,
desired nothing better than protracted litigation between these claimants and
the heir, in the certainty that meantime they should reap the benefit.
</p>

<p>
Among the American corps of claimants there were men of all classes—from
common labourers, saloon-keepers, etc, up to judges, editors, financiers,
merchants; and many of them were clever, far-seeing persons, who, without
putting any weight upon the somewhat strained “rights” they
professed to believe in, still thought that there was “something in it,
you know,” and money might be got by persistent agitation, if it was only
hush-money.
</p>

<p>
Throughout many turbulent States there was at one time quite a feeling aroused
against England (which added its venom to the unfortunate <i>Alabama</i>
business), as having unjustly kept what was due to American citizens. These
societies had their regular agents in Stirmingham and London, whose duty it was
to report every change that took place, every variation of the case, and to
accumulate evidence and transmit it. These bulletins were received by the
“caucuses,” and sometimes printed in the <i>Gazettes</i>.
</p>

<p>
Besides these regular organisations, who had money at disposal and were really
formidable, there were several free lances careering over the country,
representing themselves as the sons of the elder brother of Romy Baskette, the
brother who had disappeared with the gipsies. These were downright impostors,
and yet got a living out of the case. Several lecturers also promenaded the
States, who made a good thing of it by giving a popular version of the story,
illustrated by a diorama of incidents in the lives of the principal actors,
from the shooting of Will Baskette to the appearance of Lucia Marese as Lady
Godiva. It was singular that no one presented himself as a descendant of Arthur
Sibbold; he seemed to have been quite forgotten. So much for America.
</p>

<p>
From Australia there came, time after time, the most startling reports, as is
usual when any <i>cause célèbre</i> is proceeding in the Old
World. Now, it was a miner at the diggings who had made extraordinary
disclosures; now, some shepherd on a sheep-run, after a fit of illness, found
his memory returned, and recollected where important deeds were deposited.
</p>

<p>
Nothing, however, came of it. The principal seats of disturbance were America
and England; for England produced a crop of what we may call Provisional, or
Partial Claimants. Here and there, scattered all over the country—from
Kent to Cornwall, from Hampshire to Northumberland—were people of the
name of Baskette, which is a very ancient English cognomen, and to be found in
every collection of surnames.
</p>

<p>
Most of these were of little or no consequence, but one or two held good
positions as gentlemen or merchants. None of these latter made the shadow of a
pretence to the estate, but they were fond of speculating as to their possible
remote connection with the now famous Baskette stock; and some said that if
anything did turn up, if any practical results followed the American attempt,
it would be as well to be prepared to take a share in the spoil.
</p>

<p>
There were also at least three impostors—utter scoundrels, who obtained a
profusion of drink and some sustenance from credulous fools in tap-rooms by
pretending that they were descendants of the elder brother of Romy Baskette.
They had not the shadow of a proof, and ought to have been treated to a dose of
“cell.”
</p>

<p>
A gipsy tribe, a travelling clan which went about the country with shooting
galleries, merry-go-rounds, peep-shows, and so on, were in the habit of
proclaiming that they were the very identical tribe from whom offshoots settled
in the historical swamp at Wolf’s Glow, in order to attract custom.
</p>

<p>
Certain persons in and around Stirmingham, whose fathers or ancestors had sold
lands to Sternhold Baskette—lands now worth ten, and in some cases a
thousand, times the price he had given for them—had a fallacious idea
that if the title of the heir was upset, they would have a chance of regaining
possession, or at least of an additional payment for the property.
</p>

<p>
They formed themselves into a loosely-compacted society to protect their
interest. It was remarkable that in England, as in America, no one set up a
claim to be the descendant of Arthur Sibbold. The real danger was from America,
the land of organisation.
</p>

<p>
But in England there was a class of persons who, without possessing any
personal interest in the matter, made it their especial business to collect all
the “ana” that could be discovered, and gained a livelihood out of
their study of the case. More than one private inquiry office in London
received large fees from New York clients to make special investigations. The
credulity of mankind is exhibited in a striking manner in the support given to
these offices. How should they be supposed to be so devotedly attached to the
cause of one client? What is to prevent them having fifty, all with the same
end, and from selling the information gained from one to the other?
</p>

<p>
There were men who made it a speciality of their trade to collect all books,
pamphlets, pictures, lectures, genealogies, deeds, documents, letters, papers,
<i>souvenirs</i>—anything and everything, from Sternhold Baskette’s
old hat upwards, that could be twisted into relation with the case.
</p>

<p>
Those who have never had any leaning towards antiquarian research have no idea
of the enormous business done in this way—not only in reference to great
cases of this kind, but in reference to matters that would appear to an
outsider as absolutely not worth a thought. There is scarcely a scrap of
written or printed paper of the last century, or up to within fifty years of
the present date, which has not got its value to such a collector, for he knows
there will be fools to buy them. Sometimes it happens that an apparently
worthless piece of paper or parchment, bought as waste, turns out, under his
sharp eye, to be a really awkward thing for some owner of property unless he
purchases it.
</p>

<p>
There were lawyers in a peculiar way of business who did not disdain this
species of work, and presently they may cross our path. Such men were in
constant communication with people on the other side of the Atlantic, where
there is, year by year, an increasing desire manifested to trace out
genealogies.
</p>

<p>
The year in which, in the ordinary course of events, the building societies and
the Corporation must relinquish their expired leases was now fast approaching.
Some such person as has been described was seized with a brilliant idea, and
made haste to advertise it. Why should not all the claimants to the estate meet
on the disputed spot at this critical moment? Why should there not be a regular
family council, the largest and most important that had ever taken place? The
idea was a good one, and spread like wildfire. The newspapers took it up; the
American societies thought highly of it. Nothing like a grand demonstration.
</p>

<p>
The upshot was that Stirmingham began to look forward to the assembling of
these would-be monarchs of the city, which was finally, after much discussion,
fixed for the next New Year’s Day.
</p>

<p>
This New Year’s Day was fast approaching, while Marese and Theodore
planned.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Thirteen.</h3>

<p>
The grand family council was to be held at Stirmingham on the coming New
Year’s Day. How difficult it is to trace the genesis of an idea! It does
not seem to have any regular growth—to begin with a seed and cast out
roots, a stem, branches, leaves; it shoots now one way, now this, like those
curious creatures revealed by the microscope, or like the germs of fungi. Upon
the original thought odd branches are engrafted, accidental circumstances
suggest new developments, till at last the full completed idea bears no sort of
resemblance to what might have been expected from the embryo.
</p>

<p>
How the idea was first started neither Marese nor Theodore could tell, nor how
it was communicated from one to the other. There is a method of communication
which is not dependent upon direct speech; there is a way of talking at a
subject without mentioning it. When two clever men’s minds are full of
one absorbing topic it does not require formal sentences to convey their
conceptions. They did not seem even to actually talk of it, and yet it grew and
grew, till it overshadowed them like a vast gloomy mountain.
</p>

<p>
It would not be just to so much as hint at a latent insanity in these
men’s minds, for it would partly absolve them from responsibility, and
would dispose their judges to regard their crimes leniently. Certainly no one,
if asked to do so, could have pointed out two keener men of the world than
these. Yet, somehow, despite one’s reluctance to afford them the shadow
of an excuse, there does creep in the conviction that such a ghastly conception
could only be formed in a brain lacking the moral organs, if such an expression
may be used, in a brain unbalanced with natural human sympathy.
</p>

<p>
Marese’s father, old Sternhold, had certainly been mad at one period of
his career. His mother, Lucia, had exhibited a vanity so overweening, and a
temper so intense, that at times it resembled lunacy. It may have been that,
along with the mental powers of calculation and invention which distinguished
old Romy and Sternhold, Marese had also inherited the mental weakness of
Sternhold and Lucia.
</p>

<p>
Theodore had shown a taste for extraordinary studies usually avoided by
healthy-minded men. His father, Aurelian, had passed the whole of his time with
insane patients, and it is said that too much contact with mad people reacts
upon the sane. He had early initiated his son into the mysteries of that sad
science of the mind which deals with its deficiencies. The son’s youth
had been passed in constant intercourse with those harmless and, so to say,
<i>reasonable</i> lunatics who are to be met with in the homes and at the
dinner-tables of medical men, and whose partial sanity and occasional singular
flashes of unnatural intelligence are perhaps more calculated to affect the
minds of others than the vagaries of the downright mad.
</p>

<p>
In one short sentence, this terrible crime, which was looming over Marese and
Theodore, was nothing less than the deliberate intention to destroy the whole
of the claimants to the estate at once. How it originated it is difficult to
imagine, but it did. It might perhaps be partly traced to the injunction in
Aurelian’s papers to take the weapons out of the hands of the companies;
or partly to the oft-expressed wish of Marese’s, after the Roman emperor,
that all the claimants had but one neck, so that he might cut it. The said
emperor has much to answer for.
</p>

<p>
The announced gathering of the claimants at Stirmingham certainly seemed to
bring them all within the reach of the fowler’s net, if he could but cast
it aright. Marese and Theodore had half-formed ideas of blowing the whole
company into the air as they sat at council in the Sternhold Hall on New
Year’s Day, something after the fashion of Guy Fawkes, but with a
deadlier compound than he had at his disposal—nitro-glycerine or
dynamite; especially the first might be trusted to do the work much more
effectually than gunpowder, which was also more difficult to conceal on account
of its bulk.
</p>

<p>
It will barely be believed that these two men, in the height of the nineteenth
century, calmly examined the vault under that famous hall, in order to see if
it was fitted for the purpose. This hall or assembly-room had been finished
about the time that the agitation commenced over the heir to the estate, just
before Sternhold had married, when the Corporation heaped flattery upon him. It
had been named after him.
</p>

<p>
It was a fine room, not too large, and yet of sufficient size to seat an
audience. The object was to afford a concert-room for dramatic and theatrical
performances, and also for balls. As the site was valuable, and every particle
of space had to be utilised in the centre of this mighty city, it had been
built over vaults, which were intended for bonded warehouses; but partly on
account of the high rent asked, and partly because of the dampness of the
cellars—the site was the very centre of the old Swamp—had never
been occupied. The access was bad, and there was no place for a display or
advertisement, which was another reason why the cellars had not let. There was
a certain amount of propriety in holding what was to be called “The Grand
Centennial Family Council” in this hall, built upon the centre of the
ancient Swamp, and named after the founder of the city.
</p>

<p>
Marese and Theodore, in disguise, examined the vaults, under the pretence of
being agents for London merchants desirous of opening business in Stirmingham.
There was hardly any necessity for this precaution, for it was so many years
since they had openly resided in the place that few would have recognised them.
</p>

<p>
To their great surprise, these vaults, whose gloomy darkness they explored by
the light of lanterns, extended in one vast cavern, under the whole of the
hall. Instead of a series of cellars, there was one huge cavern. This was
occasioned by the flooring not being supported upon brick arches, as would have
been architecturally preferable, but upon timber posts, or pillars. The place
had, in fact, been put up hastily, and the vaults were never completed. The
timber pillars were placed in regular order, and it had been intended to build
brick partitions; but as no one seemed to care to occupy the cellars, this had
never been done. The floor was extremely damp, and the whole appearance of the
place repulsive. Snails, toads, and slimy reptiles crawled about, and this
under the very stage above, upon which music, song, and dance were wont to
enliven the gay hearts of the audiences.
</p>

<p>
One great obstacle to the idea of blowing up the place was the height of these
timber posts, which was full eighteen feet, so that the roof of the vault was
high over head, and any explosives, to produce the full effect, would have to
be piled up on casks or stands. Then the hall was larger than they had
supposed, and it was apparent that the coming council would occupy but a
portion of it, and perhaps change that portion now and then, so that it would
be uncertain where to place the nitro-glycerine.
</p>

<p>
The idea, looked at from a distance and in the abstract, seemed feasible
enough; but when they came to face the physical difficulties, it was found to
be hard of realisation. There was the danger of getting the explosives into the
place, the danger of detection, and, finally, the chance of an accident
hoisting the engineer with his own petard, especially at that time of the year
when nitro-glycerine was notoriously dangerous on account of the crystals which
cold formed upon its surface, and the least jar or shake was sufficient to
cause an explosion. Obviously, the plan was a cumbrous one, and without
hesitation it was abandoned.
</p>

<p>
But the main idea, that of getting rid of the claimants at one blow, was not
abandoned; it grew and grew, and occupied their minds day and night. At last
the thought of transferring the Guy Fawkes expedient from the land to the
ocean, which, once the deed was successfully accomplished, would tell no tale,
occurred to them.
</p>

<p>
The claimants must come over on shipboard, if only they could be got into one
or even two ships; and if these vessels sank upon the voyage suddenly without a
warning! This was certainly much safer for the conspirators, as no trace would
be left, and it was surer of success, because in the hall some of the victims
might escape—at sea they could scarcely do so. They ran over in their
minds the various methods of scuttling ships which have been invented from time
to time.
</p>

<p>
There was the good old simple plan of boring holes in the bottom with augurs.
There was the devilish coal-shell. A box painted to resemble coal, but really
containing powder, was thrown among the coal, and when placed in the furnace
blew up the boiler, and destroyed the ship. There was the ship-rat—a
contrivance by which the very motion of the vessel caused an augur in a box to
bore its way through, and so cause a leak. Some benevolent socialists, anxious
for the welfare of man, had also promulgated a notion of exploding
nitro-glycerine by clockwork, arranged to go so long, and set to act just as
the vessel was farthest from land.
</p>

<p>
But all these seemed to Marese and Theodore clumsy, risky, and, what was worse,
uncertain of operation. It was reserved for Marese to suggest the deadliest of
all destructive engines, and he arrived at its conception in this way. He had,
as it were, a double mind. He was liable to flashes of inspiration—such
as it was—to sudden ideas which shot through him without endeavour. He
had also the power of concentrating his thoughts, and bringing the regular
forms of logic to his assistance. But this latter method he could only practise
with the aid of pen and ink; and it was his constant habit, whenever
contemplating an important step, such as a coup upon the Exchange, to write out
his plans in a regular sequence, just as he wished them to take place.
</p>

<p>
This written guide he corrected and enlarged until it seemed beyond any further
improvement; and then shutting his eyes to all consequences, resolutely
avoiding those secret promptings which suggest that something has been left
undone, he was accustomed to rush at the matter in hand, and dispose of it with
bold, unhesitating strokes. This method certainly had its advantages, but it
had also the disadvantage that if by any accident his notes fell into other
hands, he was lost.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, after thinking and thinking in vain over this great problem, and
failing of any very brilliant flash of intelligence, Marese at last resorted to
his favourite system, and sought the solution by the aid of pen and ink. First
he wrote at the top of his rough draft—
</p>

<p>
“What is it that I desire? Define it. Definition: to destroy the
claimants. Who are the claimants? A body of men. How is a body of men to be
destroyed? In the same way as a single person. How is man destroyed? By the
knife, by bullets, by explosives, by garotting, by fire, by water, by poison,
narcotics.”
</p>

<p>
Such were his rough premises. Then he laid the pen down and thought. Why not
set the vessels these men were coming over in on fire? That at first seemed to
him a most feasible plan, far superior to the uncertain action of explosives.
It required some arrangement, which he felt confident the scientific knowledge
of Theodore could easily supply, to cause the flames to break out at the proper
moment.
</p>

<p>
He began to grow enraptured with it. It seemed so easy and sure. Then,
picturing in his mind the vessel sinking, the thought occurred to him that if
the risk was to be run, something might as well be got out of it. Why not put a
cargo on board insured far beyond its value, and so kill two birds with one
stone?
</p>

<p>
At one blow to destroy his enemies and fill his own pockets was superb triumph!
He called Theodore and explained the idea to him. Theodore was struck with
it—especially with the notion of making a profit out of the risk. He was,
however, considerably opposed to the insurance dodge, on the ground that it had
been tried so often, and people had got so keen that it was ten to one if some
suspicion did not arise, especially when it was seen what an object it would be
to Marese to secure the destruction of the passengers. Some other plan must be
adopted. Suppose, for instance, they took Marese’s yacht and followed the
vessel, and after its partial destruction, if they could secure only partial
destruction, put in a claim for salvage. To do this they must encounter serious
difficulties, but it would be far less risky.
</p>

<p>
Marese wished to know what substances they could employ to produce a fire which
could not be extinguished without some special chemical composition. Theodore
produced a series of manuscript volumes containing the notes which he had
accumulated during his long and curious studies. He turned them over one by
one, extracting such information as appeared applicable to their purpose, while
Marese, waiting for his friend’s reply, amused himself by reading pieces
here and there. It was while thus employed that the devilish means by which
their end could be obtained occurred to him.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Fourteen.</h3>

<p>
He happened to light on a volume of notes made upon the remarkable properties
of gases. They began with a description of those curious caves and even meadows
abroad wherein no animal can live, and the place is strewn with the bones of
birds and beasts who have incautiously entered the infected circle. This effect
was proved to proceed from a vapour which rose up from the earth, and was no
sooner breathed than it produced asphyxiation. Animals who inhaled it fell as
if shot, so sudden was the action.
</p>

<p>
Gases as deleterious were often generated in wells, caves, and confined places,
such as the huge tuns or casks used by brewers to keep their beer in, and which
had often proved fatal to the men who attempted to scour them out.
</p>

<p>
Theodore believed that the cold shiver which some persons affected to feel upon
entering a churchyard and passing over the graves of the dead, was caused by
the presence of a gas in small quantities, evolved from the decaying remains
beneath the feet. Then there were gases which upon inhalation caused a profound
slumber; others which had precisely an opposite result, and made the patient
lively and brisk; and others which rendered the person who took them perfectly
insensible to surgical operations.
</p>

<p>
Marese, a man who had never paid the least regard to science, was deeply struck
with these facts, with which the veriest tyro in chemistry is well acquainted.
But he did what no tyro or even advanced student would perhaps have
done—he applied his discovery—for so it was to him—to his own
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
There are, says Bacon, three modes of reading—one to pass away an idle
hour, one to acquire a knowledge of a subject, and the third and the most
advantageous method is always to keep your own ends in view, and to apply
everything to your object.
</p>

<p>
In these gases Marese found his desideratum. His engine of destruction burst
upon his mind, as it were, complete in a moment. Some such poisonous gas should
be shipped on board these vessels, closely confined in a box or other
receptacle, and at the proper moment liberated, to spread throughout the
steamer a subtle vapour which no man could see coming, and against which
strength, skill, and discipline would be perfectly powerless.
</p>

<p>
Theodore, looking up, saw a change upon Marese’s countenance, and
immediately knew that something had occurred to him. The heir was pale as
death; his own conception, so ghastly and treacherous, filled him with a
nameless horror at the same moment that he never hesitated in his purpose.
</p>

<p>
After a while he took up a pen and added to his already written premises the
conclusion—his idea in a few brief sentences—and handed it to
Theodore. He left it to Theodore to select the gas, and to arrange the
mechanical details. He had sown the seed, the other must patiently tend it. And
the other did patiently tend it; and this is what it grew to.
</p>

<p>
The name of the gas which Theodore at last, after much thought, fixed upon
shall not be here disclosed; for although it is well-known to chemists, and any
one who can read could easily find it, there is no knowing what imitations
might not spring up if they were aware of the means being so ready at hand.
</p>

<p>
Though suicide is such a simple and obvious expedient in difficulties, yet
there are scores who do not commit it because they never think of it. If some
kind friend suggested the pistol or the knife they would at once employ it.
</p>

<p>
Gas had one property which rendered it peculiarly fitted for the purpose in
view. Being elastic, it could be compressed to a great extent, and thus an
immense volume might be contained in a small compass. Therefore the case or
receptacle to hold the vapour poison need not be of large dimensions; and this
was a matter of some importance.
</p>

<p>
The gas chosen was not in any way explosive; on the contrary, it had the
property of extinguishing any light which was placed in it—there was thus
no danger of any accidental circumstance causing an explosion at an awkward
moment. It was absolutely safe—the operator ran no risk, provided always
that he did not inhale the vapour.
</p>

<p>
Theodore sketched out a case about three feet square, which was to be formed of
an outer box of deal, and an inner skin of thin iron. Into this case, which
would be tolerably strong, he proposed to pump a vast volume of gas, taking
care that the pressure should not exceed the power of the box to withstand. The
aperture through which it had been pumped was then to be hermetically sealed
with molten lead.
</p>

<p>
The greatest difficulty was to provide for the escape of the devilish vapour at
the proper moment; and this caused the projectors much reflection. Clockwork
was objectionable; it was liable to injury from jars and shakes. Cases of this
character, which looked strong and substantial, and would be placed in the
hold, would be certain to receive the roughest of usage.
</p>

<p>
At one time he conceived the idea of relying upon the cupidity of the seamen.
It was suspected that many of the accidents which had taken place at sea, and
caused the destruction of hundreds by fire, had arisen through dishonest seamen
or <i>employés</i> on board going at night with a candle into the
compartment where valuable goods were stowed, and dropping sparks.
</p>

<p>
Why not utilise this propensity? Mark the case “watches,”
“jewellery,” or “bullion,” cause it to be surrounded
with a certain amount of mystery and precaution enough to engender suspicion;
and leave the rest to the chisel and drill of the would-be thief.
</p>

<p>
But this, though clever, was too uncertain. Another idea which occurred to him
was to have a wooden case only, but a strong one, and to confine in a small
hole prepared for the purpose one of the boring insects, which in a certain
time would be sure to eat its way through and leave an aperture.
</p>

<p>
This, too, was more ingenious than practicable. He was delayed for a time.
Accident solved the difficulty. Passing through the streets, he was stopped by
a crowd which had collected around a quack doctor.
</p>

<p>
“See,” cried the vendor of patent vegetable pills, “here is
the horrid stuff the allopathists, the doctors and physicians sell to you at
high prices. Here is a common drug used by them in this phial. I will pour some
of the liquid upon the hard stone pavement—just see how it acts upon the
granite, and then guess how your wretched stomachs must be abused.”
</p>

<p>
He poured it on the stone—the crowd pressed forward, and saw it eat a
hole. “Aquafortis,” thought Theodore, and the idea was
his—aquafortis was the agent he wanted.
</p>

<p>
He passed on, and left the crowd thoroughly convinced of the tricks played by
the medical faculty, and purchasing largely of the vegetable pills. Theodore
had found a substance which would eat through his iron and wood cases, and
leave an aperture—a substance, too, whose action was equal, and could be
regulated to a sufficiently accurate extent.
</p>

<p>
Upon reflection, however, and after making several experiments, he did not
employ ordinary aquafortis, but another acid equally powerful, and which was
still more regular in its action. He tried the experiment time after time, till
at last he obtained the proper strength, and fixed the requisite amount of acid
to eat through a given thickness of iron and wood in a certain time. He
repeated the experiment till he was absolutely certain of the result.
</p>

<p>
The plan had now grown delightfully clear and well-defined—the infernal
machine became of the simplest construction. All that had to be done was to
place the acid in the case confined in a small and very thin copper vessel
(lined with an enamel to resist it), which was to be screwed to one side of the
case, then pump the gas in, hermetically seal it, heave the whole thing on
board the steamer, and leave it to work its way. Delightfully simple!
</p>

<p>
He called Marese to look over his drawings, and to witness his experiments with
the acid. Marese was enchanted; his confidence in Theodore’s scientific
resources was confirmed. There was, however, one question he asked—Was
the gas so strong and so poisonous that the small quantity confined in a case
three feet square would destroy a whole ship’s company? Would not the gas
escape, rise up, and dissipate itself through the port-holes, up the hatchways,
and be further weakened by the breezes that blew and caused draught in various
places between decks? These ocean steamers were very roomy.
</p>

<p>
Theodore was delighted to have an opportunity of explaining the properties and
nature of the vapour to his friend. The peculiarity of this gas was that,
although an invisible fluid, it was extremely heavy—it was heavier far
than atmospheric air. He easily proved that a gas might be heavier than air by
a well-known experiment with a vapour (not the one to be used in this case)
which he poured out of a glass phial over a candle. The invisible gas descended
and extinguished the candle; There was not the slightest chance of the
poison-vapour escaping quickly through ports or up hatchways. It would, as it
were, cling to the vessel. The pressure inside the case would cause it to issue
rapidly from the aperture eaten out by the acid. It would then diffuse itself
laterally, and gradually penetrate into every crevice and corner of the ship.
The effect would be that one by one every person on board would inhale it, and
in an instant, let the quantity breathed be never so small, down he would drop,
or grow rigid as he sat—unconscious was the word Theodore used as an
euphemism for death. He did not mention another effect it would have, lest the
horror of it should cause even Marese to falter.
</p>

<p>
Theodore traced out the probable course of events on board the fated vessel.
First, the persons working or living in the cabins and places nearest the case
would feel the effect and succumb. Then there would be alarm and
excitement—others would rush to the spot, and they would immediately
fall, just as the birds and beast did who entered those fatal caves abroad. One
man on board, perhaps, might detect the cause—the surgeon, or any doctor
who chanced to be a passenger—and might cry out to man the boats and
escape; but who, in the hurry and excitement, would heed him?—he would
not have time to escape himself, much less to explain the danger to others. It
was doubtful whether even so much as a signal of distress would be hoisted. The
crew, the officers, the passengers would be so completely puzzled, so utterly
at their wit’s end, that no course would suggest itself to them before it
was too late.
</p>

<p>
In this respect the gas had an immense advantage over any apparatus which would
set the ship on fire. Let the fire be never so rapid, one boat at least might
get away, and on that boat the very person whom it was most desirable should
seek the floor of the ocean. Moreover, fire could be seen from a vast distance,
and might attract attention from other vessels, who by day would observe the
smoke, and by night the glare of the flames.
</p>

<p>
But in this case probably not so much as a flag would be hoisted. One by one
the seamen and passengers, the captain and officers, would succumb to the
invisible vapour, first becoming weak and helpless, and next
“unconscious.” The steersman would fall at the wheel. The engineer
would drop at his engine; the stoker as he shovelled up the coal; the passenger
would lie in his berth. And the steamer, so long as the fuel in the furnace
lasted, would pursue her way unguided over the waves; finally, after a few
hours, to float a derelict at the mercy of the wind.
</p>

<p>
There was a completeness, a finish, an elaboration of detail about this scheme
which fascinated the conspirators. It was so novel, daring, and yet safe, it
enchanted them. When at last the great horror was discovered, what risk would
there be? Nothing on board would excite suspicion. The gas had actually no
smell; besides, long before anything was discovered, it would have dissipated
itself.
</p>

<p>
Even if the whole of the cargo was examined, the case itself would offer, no
handle to an inquirer. The powerful acid would have eaten its way out, and
nothing would be left but a small empty case with a hole in it. Nothing need
show who consigned the case. Better still: Marese’s yacht would follow
the doomed steamer, keeping close on pretence of the safety of having company
in a voyage across the Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
They would easily know when the desired result was obtained by the view of the
steamer rolling helplessly in the trough of the waves. By the time that was the
case some hours would have elapsed after the catastrophe, and various pretences
could be arranged to avoid immediately proceeding on board—especially as
from a distance nothing would look the matter—and by then the poisonous
vapour would have dissipated itself, or so mixed with the air as to have lost
its fatal power. They would then take charge of the vessel and bring it into
port, and claim the salvage.
</p>

<p>
If they contrived to select a vessel which carried a valuable cargo, that
salvage money would be something extremely large in amount, added to the value
of the steamer itself. They might manoeuvre to get such a cargo stored. This
would be far superior to the clumsy dodge of sinking the ship and claiming the
insurance money.
</p>

<p>
As to getting the case on board, it was as easy as could be. Having proceeded
to New York in Marese’s yacht, taking with them the necessary apparatus
for producing the gas (which was very simple), and pumping it into the case,
they could ascertain the hour of the steamer’s departure, fill the case,
regulate the acid for say four, or perhaps three days, and send it on board
only a little while before she started. They would then, on board the yacht,
proceed to sea on a cruise and keep the steamer in sight.
</p>

<p>
Delightfully simple! Perfectly complete and scientific in every detail!
</p>

<p>
Marese once again asked if the gas was really so powerful? Theodore referred to
his note-books, and showed him an extract from a newspaper not of so very
remote a date, wherein it was stated that at a conference of the various
leading European Powers it had been resolved not to employ certain implements
in warfare, such as explosive shells or bullets under a certain size, and
poisonous gases or vapours which could be thrown into a fortress or town in
shells. Marese was convinced, and regarded the engine as perfect.
</p>

<p>
Thus did two men deliberately plan out the destruction of several hundreds of
their fellow-beings without one single thought or reflection upon the misery
and suffering they would cause, or upon the intrinsic villainy of the act.
</p>

<p>
Well was it suggested by a French thinker that certain natures are incapable of
feeling, incapable of remorse so long as they remain “faithful to the
logic of their type”—i.e. faithful to their own selfish interests
and passions.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Fifteen.</h3>

<p>
With his own hands Theodore constructed the infernal machine and prepared the
materials for generating the deadly vapour at the shortest notice. This, the
first part of the scheme, having been settled, there remained two great
difficulties to overcome. The first was to get the claimants on board one
vessel—travelling in a body; and the second was to secure their passage
by a steamer carrying a valuable cargo, so as to increase the gain of salvage
money to the utmost.
</p>

<p>
It was not easy to manage the first matter; the latter Marese thought he saw
his way through. It happened just then that the payment of the war indemnity to
Germany caused a great drain of gold from this country; the value of the
precious metals consequently rose, and the imports increased to meet the
demand. Gold and silver came in large quantities from New York, both in coin
and bullion—especially silver.
</p>

<p>
Marese intended to take advantage of this fact. By means of certain Stock
Exchange operations, with which he was perfectly familiar, having employed them
previously on several occasions, he arranged that a very large amount of
bullion should be transmitted to London from New York by the splendid steamer
<i>Lucca</i>, due to start on December 3rd.
</p>

<p>
It must be understood that this bullion was not to be despatched to Marese, and
that he did not appear in the transaction as having any direct connection with
it. He had, in fact, arranged to lose a small sum of money, in order to render
the importation of bullion particularly profitable in the week ending December
17th—profitable not to him, but to those speculators who deal in precious
metal just as others do in corn or calico. Marese omitted no precaution, Spared
no pains, and used the whole of his natural and acquired cunning to render this
operation a certainty.
</p>

<p>
The next thing was to tempt the claimants to travel by the steamer
<i>Lucca</i>. After considerable hesitation, Marese at last determined to open
negotiations with the leading men amongst them. He did not do this in his own
person, but through his solicitors. It was represented to the managers of the
Baskette and Sibbold Lodges that really their claims and the interests of the
heir—i.e. Marese—were not so divergent as had been supposed. The
heir was quite as much excluded from the enjoyment of the property as they
were, and finding the building societies determined, by every means in their
power, to put off the day when they must yield up possession, he wished to make
common cause against these companies.
</p>

<p>
Nor was this statement altogether fictitious. The idea of strengthening the
hands of the claimants, and making common cause with them, had often occurred
to Marese, for the sole purpose of taking the weapons of the companies out of
their hands, as Aurelian had advised.
</p>

<p>
No sooner was this overture on the part of the heir received in America than
both Lodges at once responded, and without a moment’s hesitation fell
into the snare laid for them. To us, who are acquainted with the infamous
designs of Marese, such conduct seems almost senile; but it must be remembered
that these men on the other side of the Atlantic had not the slightest
suspicion of the deadly engine which had been preparing.
</p>

<p>
To some extent the sudden overture of the heir caused a cessation of
hostilities between the two Lodges, and when Marese’s second offer
arrived they held a species of jubilee. This offer was nothing less than to
convey the whole of the claimants at his own expense, and added that he had
already notified to the owners of the <i>Lucca</i> that he might require the
entire passage accommodation, or nearly, of that vessel. To the Americans this
came as an immense boon. There were many of them comparatively poor men, to
whom the cost of the voyage was a serious matter, and who had already begun to
hesitate at the prospect before them.
</p>

<p>
The diabolical foresight of Marese and Theodore had guessed as much. They said
to each other, “Half the claimants will not come—only those who are
tolerably well off. Then what will be the use of our scheme? We shall destroy
only a few, and from the remaining individuals a new crop will spring up to vex
us. We must get them all—all!”
</p>

<p>
This offer was accepted with a <i>fanfaronnade</i> of gratitude. It had one
inestimable advantage—it secured the passage of the claimants by the
vessel Marese had chosen. The enthusiasm on the other side of the Atlantic was
raised to its highest pitch when the heir announced his intention of coming to
New York in his yacht, to see that the arrangements, for his friends were
properly carried out.
</p>

<p>
Preparations were at once made to give him an ovation. The authorities of New
York city gave orders to do him honour. The papers published biographies of
“this distinguished man, upon whom the eyes of all the world were
fixed,” and who had lately “covered himself with glory by
displaying a grand generosity towards the offshoots of the parent stem.”
</p>

<p>
It often happens that in America the descendants of particular families are
gathered in and around certain districts, where they form the main part of the
population. This was the case with the Baskettes and Sibbolds. The Baskettes
chiefly inhabited Caben, a small township west of Philadelphia, and the
Sibbolds were mostly to be found at Tandanap, near the shores of Lake Michigan.
Numbers of both tribes of course were scattered over the whole country, but
these were the strongholds. To suit both parties, and to tend to remove the
jealousies which had so long raged, it was arranged that all should meet at
Imola, a place about midway and within a hundred and twenty miles of New York,
about a week previous to the embarkation.
</p>

<p>
At Imola (named after a Continental town) there resided perhaps the wealthiest
member of the Baskette and Sibbold tribes, for he could claim relationship with
both—he offered hospitality to them all; and in return it was agreed that
this Reginald Bunker Sibbold Baskette, Esq, should be instituted the leader or
president of the expedition. After the mobilisation of the forces at Imola, the
army was to move on New York on the 2nd December, and embark the same evening
on board the <i>Lucca</i> steamship.
</p>

<p>
The whole scheme was now complete, and extremely promising it looked;
everything had turned out well. Marese had ascertained by secret inquiries that
the bullion had been ordered, and that the owners of the <i>Lucca</i> had
contracted, under a heavy bond, to deliver it at a certain date. The Lodges
had, for a time at least, fused their differences. The engine of destruction
was finished, together with a duplicate in case of accident. How extremely
simple it looked! Nothing in the world but a strong deal box, apparently nailed
together in the usual manner, about a yard square, or a little less. Just such
a box as a seaman or passenger, if it chanced to lie about, would choose to sit
down on and smoke a pipe. The rough deal planks of which it was made were not
even planed smooth—simply a strong packing-case. The conspirators
congratulated themselves upon the approaching execution of their schemes, and
the success which seemed certain to attend them.
</p>

<p>
But now Theodore discovered a serious oversight. Reading through
Aurelian’s papers a second time, he came upon that passage which detailed
all that could be learnt of the descendants of Arthur Sibbold. This Arthur,
Aurelian wrote, or his descendants, was the most dangerous of all. He was the
man who ought to have succeeded to the farm which James Sibbold took possession
of. James, or James’s sons, had not the slightest right to dispose of the
farm to Sternhold Baskette; they were selling what did not belong to them.
Arthur was of course dead, but Arthur’s heirs still lived; and then
followed the address and further particulars.
</p>

<p>
These heirs were at present quiet; but if they discovered the register of
Arthur’s marriage, Aurelian could not see what was to prevent them from
putting in a claim far superior either to Marese’s or to that of any
other person. Even if they could not get possession, the Courts would certainly
order an immense sum to be paid to them, as compensation; and Aurelian thought
himself that nothing in the world could prevent them taking the property which
stood on the site of the farm, if not the Swamp. The property on the site of
the farm, he thought, must go.
</p>

<p>
“Now,” said Theodore, “what is the use of destroying the
American claimants <i>en masse</i> if this even greater danger is to be allowed
to remain close at home, within easy reach of the estate, ready at any moment
to burst upon us and render nugatory all our risk and labour?”
</p>

<p>
Marese was thunderstruck. For a time it seemed that their enemies were
hydra-headed—no sooner was one head cut off than three sprouted up in the
place. But the man was not one to be daunted. This also must be done, he said.
They had not much time now to lose. It was already the middle of September, and
a fortnight must be reckoned for the passage of the yacht to New York. They
spent anxious days and nights considering a variety of plans. There is not time
to unravel the strange mazes of the mind and trace the genesis of the idea
which at last suggested itself to Theodore. It was only one degree less
ingenious, and if anything still more horrible, than the infernal machine of
Marese.
</p>

<p>
Theodore still continued the asylum at Stirmingham. It was an important source
of income, in fact. In that asylum there were confined lunatics of all degrees
of insanity, most of them having wealthy friends, and some the representatives
of large properties. Among these was one more remarkable than the rest. He was
the representative of a long line of lunatics, or semi-lunatics. Popular
tradition accused a progenitor living two centuries before of a crime too dark
to be mentioned, and believed that the lunacy of his descendants was a special
punishment from heaven. This particular individual had seemed tolerably sane
till he was permitted to marry—a cruel thing. He then rapidly developed
his inherited tendencies, living as a married man, left more free from
restraint by friends and others.
</p>

<p>
Though the owner of broad acres and lovely woodlands, he delighted in the
society of tinkers, and was himself a clever hand at mending pots and kettles.
He had such a fancy for tinkering that he actually promenaded the country for
miles in company with gipsies, calling at the farmhouses—on his own
tenants—asking for things to mend.
</p>

<p>
He was also absurdly fond of dogs, and filled the house with
them—especially the large mastiff breed, of which he was particularly
enraptured, till no one could approach it, and his poor wife was frightened out
of her senses. Tinkering, fondling these dogs, and playing the tin whistle
occupied his time. His money he scattered far and wide among the gipsies,
pedlars, and tinkers, and gave enormous sums for the pure-bred mastiffs.
</p>

<p>
The countenance of the man expressed the most intense melancholy—that
hopeless incurable vacancy of look which is seen on the features of some
monkeys while in captivity. His face, and the shape of his head, in fact, much
resembled a monkey’s; and the ears protruding from the side of the skull,
very large and ill-formed, completed the resemblance. He had a favourite resort
in one of the woods surrounding the family mansion. Through this wood there ran
a stream, and a tree had fallen across it, making a natural bridge.
</p>

<p>
On this tree, over the stream, he would perch himself astride, his feet nearly
in the water, and play for hours upon the tin whistle, while his troop of dogs
disported in the woods around. He had a wonderful instinct of music, and really
played in a marvellous manner upon this simple instrument, exhibiting skill
even in the choice of the whistle—for it is difficult to find one that
has a mellow tone.
</p>

<p>
The spectacle of this being, sitting on the tree trunk in the gloom of the
woods, his long legs dangling down to the water, with his melancholy baboon
face, performing extraordinary fantasias upon a tin whistle, could hardly be
matched.
</p>

<p>
But he was as cunning as he was mad. Probably from his companions, the gipsies,
he had learnt that his ancestors had all been confined in the madhouse. He had
sufficient sense to foresee that the moment a son was born to his wife he would
himself be confined. But, with the inherent insanity of his nature, he thought
that by killing the wife or the son he should escape this danger.
</p>

<p>
So soon as ever the wretched wife’s confinement approached he slew
her—and slew her in true fantastic fashion. With his tinker’s
hammer he drove a nail into her head as she slept. He fled from the place, but
was captured; and that was the last time Odo Lechester used his tinker’s
hammer for some time to come. The dreadful deed, the sight of blood, had
developed in him the homicidal tendency—he tried hard to stab his
captors. In Aurelian’s asylum at Stirmingham he desperately wounded a
warder.
</p>

<p>
This was the being Theodore selected for his purpose. The man had made many
violent attempts to escape—he was like a wild beast in a cage, pacing to
and fro.
</p>

<p>
Theodore went down to Stirmingham to his private residence, which adjoined the
asylum, to prepare his tool for the deed. It was easy for him, as a physician
and the owner of the establishment, to have full and private access to Odo
Lechester. He had a fortnight for his task. In that time he succeeded in
impressing upon Odo’s mind that the persons whose name and address he
gave him were those who were responsible for his confinement.
</p>

<p>
It was not his (Theodore’s) fault that he was confined—it was the
fault of these persons, and upon them the punishment should fall. The man
imbibed the idea thoroughly: he brooded over revenge if ever he should get
free. His one-sided mind became absorbed in two great overmastering
passions—to revenge his captivity, and to recover his favourite dogs.
</p>

<p>
Theodore assured him that if ever these persons were out of the way he would be
at once reinstalled in his position, and might wander at his sweet will,
tinkering and playing his whistle.
</p>

<p>
Theodore’s plan was to let this irresponsible murderer out at large upon
the world. The obnoxious persons would be removed, and no one could be
punished. He arranged for the escape of Odo Lechester at about the date he and
Marese would start for New York.
</p>

<p>
Their plans were now complete. Theodore, in order to obtain the lunatic’s
goodwill, had restored to him his whistle; and he roamed to and fro in the
court of the asylum, examining the high walls, stone by stone, for a crevice of
escape, while his rapid fingers manipulated interminable airs of the merriest
kind.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
When the engineer approached the ancient Swamp with his level and theodolite,
and was followed by an army of workmen in short corduroys and slops, who
cleared away the rushes and bull-polls, swept off the willow-beds and
watercress, drove the waterfowl away and plucked up the reeds and sedges, then
the water-rat knew that his time was come. The teeth that had nibbled away at
the willow-tree root till it fell and blocked up the stream, would nibble no
more. The nimble feet and black eyes would be seen no more biding among the
flags, or plunging out of sight into the water as a footstep was heard.
</p>

<p>
The lake which the water-rat had made, with its islands and its cotters, was in
its way useful, and not altogether despicable. The poor basket-makers, humble
as they were, made good and useful baskets, mended pots and pans, split good
clothes-pegs, and injured no man till Sibbold fired that fatal shot.
</p>

<p>
From that hour a curse seemed to hang over the place. A vast city, full of
seething human life, had taken the place of the swamp and the bullrushes; the
hearths of the poor cotters were gone, and huge hotels, club-houses, theatres,
were there instead. Progress and development—yes; but with development
came crime.
</p>

<p>
Under that overgrown city there extended a system of tunnels, sewers—some
large enough to drive a horse and cart down them, others hardly large enough to
admit the band. But they extended everywhere. Under the busy street, under the
quiet office where the only sound was the scratching of the pen, or the buzz of
a fly “in th’ pane;” under the gay theatre and the gossiping
club-house there was not a spot that was not undermined.
</p>

<p>
And in these subterranean catacombs there dwelt a race nearly as numerous as
the human hive above, who worked and gnawed in the dark; they were the domains
of the successors of the little furred creatures which nibbled down the ancient
willow tree. The grey sewer-rat worked and multiplied exceedingly beneath this
mighty city. The grey rat was worse than the water-rat.
</p>

<p>
He had his human prototypes. What were Marese and Theodore but sewer-rats
working in secret, in the dark underground, out of sight, whose presence could
hardly be detected by a faint occasional scratching or rustle?
</p>

<p>
Beside these there were a numerous company of lesser men and masculine brutes,
and female fiends, burrowing, fighting in the dark places of this mighty city,
whose presence was made known at times by faint sounds of shrieking or devilish
glee which rose up, as it were, from the bowels of the earth. The reign of the
harmless water-rat was over. The rule of the sewer-rat was now in full force.

<h2>Book II.—Persons.</h2>





<h3>One.</h3>

<p>
Forty-three miles as the crow flies, south of Stirmingham, there stands upon
the lonely Downs a solitary, lichen-grown post, originally intended to direct
wayfarers upon those trackless wastes.
</p>

<p>
In winter, when the herbage, always short, was shortest, and when the ground
was softened by rain, there might be detected the ruts left by waggon wheels
crossing each other in various directions; but road, or path properly
so-called, there was none, and a stranger might as well have been placed on the
desert of the Sahara. For time, and the rain blown with tremendous force across
these open Downs by the wind, had all but obliterated the painted letters upon
the cross-arms, and none but those acquainted with the country could have
understood the fragmentary inscriptions.
</p>

<p>
Some mischievous ploughboys or shepherd lads, tired of arranging flints in
fanciful rows, or cutting their names upon the turf, had improved the shining
hour by climbing up this post, pulling out the arms, and inserting them in the
opposite mortices, thereby making the poor post an unwitting liar. This same
section of the population had also energetically pelted all the milestones for
far around with flints, till the graven letters upon them were beaten out. Such
wooden wit was their only resource in a place where <i>Punch</i> never
penetrated; for this lonesome spot was appropriately named World’s End,
or, it was locally pronounced, Wurdel’s End.
</p>

<p>
The undulating downs surrounded it upon every side, dotted here and there at
long distances with farmsteads and a few cottages, and now and then a small
village or hamlet of ten or a dozen houses grouped together in a
“combe,” or narrow valley, where there happened to be a spring of
water and a “bourne” or stream. Yet World’s End was not
altogether to be despised. In this out-of-the-way place there was perhaps the
finest natural racecourse in England, to which the uneven uphill course at
Epsom, made famous by the Derby, was but an exercise ground.
</p>

<p>
A level stretch of sweet, elastic turf, half a mile wide, ran in a line
something like half a horse-shoe, under the steep Downs, for a distance of two
miles, unimpeded by hedge, ditch, or enclosed field, and obstructed only in a
few spots by thick bushes of furze and a few scattered hawthorn trees.
</p>

<p>
A spectator standing upon the Downs had the whole of this Plain, as it was
called, at once under his eye; could see a horse start and watch it gallop to
the goal. From an ancient earthwork camp or “castle,” this Down was
known as Berbury Hill, and the level plain was often called Berbury racecourse.
</p>

<p>
For from time immemorial rustic sports, and local races between the horses of
the neighbouring farmers, had taken place twice a year under the Berbury Hill.
The sports were held in the early spring; the races proper, according to
custom, came off in October. They were of the most primitive character, as may
be judged from the following poster, which the kindness of a printer and
bookbinder at Barnham—the nearest town—enables us to present to the
reader. He had preserved a copy of it, having returned the original to the
committee, who sat at the Shepherd’s Bush Inn upon the Downs:—
</p>

<p>
“Take Notiss. The Public is hereby Invite to the Grand open and Hurdle
Rases and Steple-Chaces at Wurdel’s End which is to come off on Wensday
after old Michelmuss Day. All particlars of the Stewards which is Martin Brown,
William Smith, Philip Lewis, Ted Pontin. Illegul Beting is stoped.”
</p>

<p>
This copy had in the corner, “Please print two Score and send by
Carrier,” and the unfortunate printer, ashamed to issue such a circular,
sent it back with an amended form for approval; but the carrier forgot the
letter, and it was not delivered till a week after the event—not that
much was lost by the failure to give this species of publicity to the races.
The day was well-known to all those who were likely to attend. The half-dozen
gipsies, with the cocoanut sticks and gingerbread stall, duly arrived, and took
up their quarters in a fir copse where the ground was dry, and the tree-trunks
sheltered them somewhat from the breeze which always blows over the Downs.
</p>

<p>
Most of the spectators were hill men. There still lingers the old feud between
the hill and vale—not so fierce, toned down to an occasional
growl—but Nature herself seems to have provided a never-ceasing ground of
quarrel. These two races, the hill and the vale men, must always put up
opposing prayers to heaven. The vale prays for fine and dry weather; the hill
prays for wet. How then can they possibly agree? Not more than three knots of
men and half a dozen wenches came up from the vale, and these gave pretty good
evidence that they had called <i>en route</i> at the Shepherd’s Bush, for
they were singing in chorus the lament of the young woman who went to the
trysting place to meet her faithless swain:—
</p>

<p class="poem">
But what was there to make her sad?<br />
The gate was there, but not the lad;<br />
Which made poor Mary to sigh and to say<br />
Young William shan’t be mine!
</p>

<p>
The committee were in a moveable shepherd’s hut on wheels, where also was
the weighing-room and the weights, some of which were stone
“quarters.”
</p>

<p>
Just where the judges post was erected the course was roped for a hundred yards
to ensure the horses arriving at the right place, but otherwise it was open. By
the side of these ropes the traps and four-wheelers and ramshackle gigs of the
farmers were drawn up, with their wives and daughters, who had come to see the
fun.
</p>

<p>
Among these there was one pony-carriage drawn by two handsome ponies, with a
peacock’s feather behind their ears and silver bells on the harness,
which, simple enough in itself, had a stylish look beside these battered and
worn-out vehicles. It belonged to Jason Waldron, who was generally credited
with “Esquire” after his name, and the lady who sat alone in it was
his daughter Violet. Mr Waldron was not there.
</p>

<p>
Violet was attended by a young man, plainly dressed, very pale, whose slight
frame gave him an effeminate appearance in contrast with the burly forms, and
weather-beaten faces of those acquaintances who from time to time nodded and
spoke as they passed. The pony-carriage was drawn up under an ancient hawthorn
tree, whose gnarled and twisted trunk, slow in growth, may have witnessed the
formation of the entrenchment on the hill by the Britons themselves. The first
frosts of autumn had blackened the leaves, and the mingling of the grey of the
trunk and its lichen with the dark colour of the leaves and the red peggles or
berries, under a warm, glowing, mellow sunshine, caused the tree to assume a
peculiar bronze-like tint.
</p>

<p>
It may be that the sun in all his broad domains did not shine that day upon a
more lovely being than Violet Waldron. Aymer Malet, the young man at her
side—whose Norman name ill-assorted with his coarse garments, too plainly
speaking of poverty—would have sworn that her equal did not walk the
earth, and he would have had good warrant for his belief.
</p>

<p>
Poor Aymer was out of place in that rude throng, and tormented himself with
fears lest he should appear despicable in her eyes, as so inferior to those
stalwart men in size and strength. He should have known better; but he was
young and had lived so long with those who despised him that a habit of
self-depreciation had insensibly grown upon him. It is needless to go back into
his pedigree. He was well descended, but an orphan and friendless, except for
the single uncle who had given a roof and a bed to lie on to his sister’s
child.
</p>

<p>
Martin Brown was a well-meaning man, honest and sturdy, but totally incapable
of comprehending that all men are not absorbed in sheep and turnips. He was
moderately well off, but, like all true farmers, frugal to the extreme. Never a
penny did Aymer get from him. Martin would have said: “Thee doesn’t
work; thee doesn’t even mind a few ewes. If thee’ll go bird-keeping
I’ll pay thee.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer wished for work, but not work of that class. He remembered one golden
year spent in London with a friend of his dead father (who had lost his all by
horse-racing), where he was permitted to read at will in a magnificent library,
and was supplied with money to visit those art-galleries and collections in
which his heart delighted. The friend died; the widow had no interest in him,
and Aymer returned to the turnips, and sheep. But even in that brief period the
impulse had been given; the seed had been sown and had fallen in fertile
ground, which gave increase a hundredfold.
</p>

<p>
The boy—he was but twenty then—was a born genius. He could not help
it; it would force him on. What he wanted was books. He could get no money to
purchase them; circulating libraries had not yet established agencies upon the
open Downs. By a strange contradiction he became a poacher, and the cleverest
hand at setting a wire for miles. Tenants were not allowed to shoot in that
district, but they might course hares as much as they pleased.
</p>

<p>
Aymer wired the ground game, sold them to the carriers who went by, and through
the carriers got books slowly and one by one from the county town. In this way
he bought many of Bohn’s fine series—the finest and most useful,
perhaps, ever issued—he read Plato and Aristotle, Livy,
Xenophon—the poets, the philosophers, the dramatists of ancient Rome and
Greece; and although it was not in their original tongue, the vivid imagination
of the man carried him back to their day, and enabled him to realise those
stirring scenes, to feel their passions, and comprehend their arguments. He
bought also most of the English poets, a few historians, and a large number of
scientific works, for he was devoured with an eager curiosity to understand the
stars that shone so brilliantly upon those hills—the phenomena of Nature
with which he was brought in daily contact. When he had mastered a book, his
friends the carriers, who called at the Shepherd’s Bush, took it back to
the county town and resold it for half-price, and these small sums went towards
fresh purchases.
</p>

<p>
It may have been that these very untoward circumstances which would, to all
appearance, have checked the growth of his mind, actually tended to assist it.
He saw—he felt Nature. The wind, that whistled through the grass and
sighed in the tops of the dark fir trees, spoke to him in a mystic language.
The great sun, in unclouded splendour slowly passing over the wide, endless
hills, told him a part of the secret. His books were not read, in the common
sense of the term: they were <i>thought</i> through. Not a sentence but was
thought over, examined, and its full meaning grasped and firmly imprinted on
the memory.
</p>

<p>
Poor Aymer! How desperately he longed to escape! How the soft summer breeze
seemed to woo him onwards he knew not whither! How the sun seemed to beckon,
till he fancied he could hear the echo of the surge as it roared on the
far-distant beach!
</p>

<p>
He did escape once—only for a little while, to be forced ignominiously
back again, amid the jeers of his acquaintances. This happened before he knew
Violet. By dint of catching hares and rabbits, and by selling off an
accumulation of books, and by disposing of his gold watch—his only
property—he managed to get some twenty pounds, and with that sum went
straight to Florence.
</p>

<p>
It was in spring, just before the warm summer comes, and he revelled in the
beauty of Italian skies and landscapes as he travelled. But his destination was
the Palazzo, which contains the statue of ideal woman, known as the Venus de
Medici. He stood before the living marble, rapt in thought, and then suddenly
burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
This was perhaps childish. He had his faults; he was extremely proud and
oversensitive. The sudden transition from the harsh and rude life at
World’s End, among the weather-beaten and rough-speaking rustics, to this
new world of inexpressible beauty, overcame him. Hastily he brushed those tears
away, and recovered himself; but not so quickly as to escape the observation of
two sad grey eyes. Inadvertently, as he stood before the statue, he had
interfered with the line of sight of a lady who was engaged in sketching. She
had paused, and noticing his rapt attention, made no sign that he had
interrupted her work. Thus she witnessed his weakness; and being a person of a
thoughtful, perhaps too thoughtful, turn, she wondered at and pondered over it.
</p>

<p>
Day by day Aymer, while his funds lasted and he could stay in Florence, came
and stood before the statue, lingering for hours in its close vicinity; so that
the artist, as she sketched, had the fullest opportunity of noting the strong
contrast between his delicate, intellectual features and slight, tall frame,
and the coarse dress he wore. Growing interested, she instructed her attendants
to make inquiries, and they easily elicited the name of the stranger, and the
place from which he had come.
</p>

<p>
By a curious coincidence, it so happened that the lady-artist herself was the
owner of a family mansion, and moderately large estate but a few miles from
Aymer’s home. He was, in fact, perfectly familiar with her name, which
was a household word at World’s End, where distinguished names were few;
but moving in his low sphere he had never seen her face.
</p>

<p>
Lady Lechester—Agnes Lechester to her friends—was “lord of
herself, that heritage of woe,” and being of an artistic turn of mind,
had spent much of her time upon the Continent; another reason being certain
unhappy matters connected with the history of the family mansion. She was much
struck with the singularity of a mere lad of low and poor estate thus coming to
Florence, obviously from pure love of the beautiful. Nothing approaching to
affection sprang up in her mind; it must be distinctly understood that her
interest was of a different character entirely. But from that moment Aymer
unconsciously became the subject of a certain amount of surveillance. He deemed
himself despised and unnoticed by all; but there was one who had not forgotten
him.
</p>

<p>
Those happy days in lovely Florence passed like a dream. Even by living on a
few fruits and a little bread alone, the scanty stock of money he had carried
with him could not be made to last for ever. Barely a month of pure, unalloyed
pleasure—pure in every sense of the term—and poor Aymer, who knew
not how to get employment in a foreign city, was obliged to return, and Agnes
Lechester saw him no more standing in rapt admiration before the famous statue.
</p>

<p>
Aymer reached Dover with five shillings in his pocket, and walked the whole of
the distance, one hundred and fifty miles, to World’s End, often sleeping
out at night under a rick. Slight as he was in frame, he possessed considerable
power of enduring fatigue, and had a way of lounging idly along the road,
abstracted in thought, and so walking mile after mile, till he woke up at his
destination.
</p>

<p>
They laughed him to scorn at World’s End. The poor fellow wandered about
in the daytime on the Downs, hiding in the fir copses, lying on the ancient
earthwork entrenchment, and dreaming of his fair Florence, so many hundreds of
miles away. He grew dejected and hopeless till he saw Violet. Then in time, the
very destiny he deemed so harsh in confining him to that rude spot seemed even
superior to the glorious possibilities he had hoped for. For Violet took the
place of the marble goddess; yet there never was a beauty less like the Venus
de Medici. Lovely as are the ideals men have created for themselves, it
sometimes happens that Nature presents us with a rare gem, surpassing those
cold conceptions of the mind as far as the sun is above the earth.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Two.</h3>

<p>
Violet returned from a long visit to friends near London just about the time
that Aymer reached home, weary and footsore, from Dover. Although The Place, as
Jason Waldron’s house was called, was but two miles from World’s
End, Aymer had never seen her. She was but rarely at home, for Waldron had
given her the best education money could buy, and this necessitated much
absence from her native hills. But, education and visits over, Violet, with a
happy heart, returned to the dear old home at last.
</p>

<p>
It was on one lovely afternoon in May that Aymer saw her for the first time. He
was lying upon the ground hidden in the brake which grew round the hedge of a
fir copse on the Downs. Through this copse there ran a narrow green lane or
track. He was reading his favourite little book of poetry—one that he
always carried in his pocket—the tiny edition of Shakespeare’s
Poems and Sonnets, published by William James Brown, thirty years since, and
now out of print.
</p>

<p>
Somehow the spirit of those sonnets and that peculiar poetry had penetrated
into his mind. The little book was annotated on its narrow margin with notes in
his own handwriting, and he knew the greater part of it by heart. He had just
read the sonnet beginning—
</p>

<p class="poem">
My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun;<br />
Coral is far more red than her lips’ red.<br />
* * * * *<br />
And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare<br />
As she belied with false compare,
</p>

<p>
when the sound of horse’s hoofs made him look up.
</p>

<p>
A lady, riding on a black horse, had entered the green lane, and was passing
slowly at a walk. It was Violet. Waldron. All that English beauty which seemed
to pervade the poetry of wonderful Will, to Aymer’s fancy appeared to be
hers. She passed him, and was gone, but her presence was left behind.
</p>

<p>
Aymer could not have analysed her then—if asked, he could have barely
recounted the colour of her hair. Yet she dwelt with him—hovered about
him; he fed upon the remembrance of her until he had seen her again. By slow
degrees he grew to understand the reason of her surpassing loveliness—to
note the separate features, to examine the colours and the lines that composed
this enchanting picture. A new life dawned upon him—a new worship, so to
say.
</p>

<p>
It happened that Martin Brown had some business to transact with Jason Waldron.
Waldron bore the reputation of being a “scholard;” he was known to
be comparatively wealthy; he did not mix with the society of World’s End;
and he was held in some sort of awe by the rude and uneducated residents in the
locality.
</p>

<p>
Much as he despised that useless Aymer Malet, Martin in his secret heart felt
that he was better fitted to meet and talk with Mr Waldron than himself. Aymer
was, therefore, accredited to The Place. He went with no little trepidation,
knowing that it was Violet’s home, and sharing to some extent the local
hesitation to meet Waldron, who, being an invalid, he had never seen. Mr
Waldron received him with a cordial courtesy, which quickly put him at his
ease. When the grey-haired, handsome old man, sitting in his Bath-chair in the
shadow of a sycamore tree, extended his hand and said: “I had some slight
knowledge of your father, Mr Malet—he came of a good family,” poor
Aymer forgot his coarse dress, and exhibited the bearing of a born gentleman.
He could not help admiring the garden in which he found his host. This
evidently genuine admiration pleased Waldron extremely, for the garden had been
the solace of his retired manhood, and of his helpless age. He began to talk
about it directly.
</p>

<p>
“It is the trees,” he said; “it is the trees that make it
look well. Trees are really far more beautiful than flowers. I planted most of
them; you have heard the Eastern saying, Mr Malet—that those who plant
trees live long. That yew-hedge?—no; I did not plant that. Such hedges
are rare now—that hedge has been growing fully a hundred years—the
stems, if you will look, are of immense size. To my mind, the old English yew
is a greater favourite than the many foreign evergreens now introduced. The
filbert walk?—yes; I planted that. Come and see me in a few months’
time, and you shall crack as many as you choose. The old house
picturesque?—it is: I wish I had a sketch of it. You draw?—a
little; now try. Take out your pocket-book—ah! I see you have a regular
artist’s sketchbook.”
</p>

<p>
To tell the honest truth, Aymer was not a little pleased to have the
opportunity of exhibiting his skill before some one who could appreciate it. He
was a natural draughtsman. I do not think he ever, even in later and more
fortunate days, attempted colours; but with pencil and crayon, or pen and ink,
he was inimitable. Once at work with his pencil, Aymer grew absorbed and forgot
everything—even the presence of the invalid, who watched him with
interest. The gables and the roof, the curious mullioned windows, the
chimney-stacks, the coat of arms and fantastic gargoyles, then the trees and
arbours grew upon the paper.
</p>

<p>
“Ah! that’s my window,” said a low voice.
</p>

<p>
His pencil slipped and made a thick stroke—he looked round, it was
Violet.
</p>

<p>
For the first time he looked into her eyes and met her face to face. He could
not draw. His hand would not keep steady; he blamed it to the heat of the
summer sun. Violet declared it was her fault.
</p>

<p>
Mr Waldron seized the incomplete sketch, and insisted upon Mr Malet (the title,
humble as it was, was pleasant to Aymer’s ears) returning to finish it
next day.
</p>

<p>
In his confusion Aymer somehow got away, and then remembered that the
sketchbook he had left behind was full of drawings, and amongst them there were
two that brought a flush to his brow as he thought of them. One was Violet on
horseback; the other a profile of her face. He wished to return and claim his
book, and yet he hesitated. A sweet uncertainty as to what she would think
mastered him. He dared not venture back. The next day passed, and the
next—still he did not go—a week, a fortnight.
</p>

<p>
He could not summon up courage. Then came a note for “A. Malet,
Esq”—that “Esq” subjected him to bitter ridicule from
rude old Martin—from Mr Waldron, inquiring if he had been ill, and
begging him to visit at The Place, according to promise.
</p>

<p>
There was no escape. He went; and from that hour the intimacy increased and
ripened till not a day passed without some part of it being spent with the
Waldrons. Violet had seen her portrait in the sketchbook, but she said not a
word. She made Aymer draw everything that took her fancy. Once he was bold
enough to ask to sketch her hand. She blushed, and became all dignity; Aymer
cowered. He was not bold enough. How could he be? With barely a shilling in his
pocket, rough corduroy trousers, an old battered hat, a black coat almost green
from long exposure to sun and rain;—after years of ridicule and jeering
how could he face her?
</p>

<p>
His heart was full, but his lips dared not speak. His timidity and
over-sensitiveness made him blind to signs and tokens that would have been
instantly apparent to others of harder mould. He never saw the overtures that
the growing love in Violet’s breast compelled her to offer. He tormented
himself day and night with thinking how to compass and obtain her love, when it
was his already.
</p>

<p>
The one great difficulty was his poverty. Think how he would, he could discover
no method by which it could be remedied. He had no means of obtaining
employment, and employment would imply absence from her. How could he make her
love him? He turned to his faithful friend and adviser, dear old Will. The tiny
volume of poems was carefully scanned, and he lit upon those verses
commencing—
</p>

<p class="poem">
When as thine eye hath chose the dame<br />
And stall’d the deer that thou shouldst strike.
</p>

<p>
He asked himself if he had done as the lover was advised—
</p>

<p class="poem">
And when thou com’st thy tale to tell<br />
Smooth not thy tongue with filed talk.
</p>

<p>
Certainly he had not attempted to beguile her with insinuating flattery—
</p>

<p class="poem">
But plainly say thou lov’st her well,<br />
And set her person forth to sale.
</p>

<p>
This he had not done. How dare he say he loved her well? He had not the courage
to praise her person.
</p>

<p class="poem">
And to her will frame all thy ways.
</p>

<p>
This he was willing and ready enough to do. He believed he had done so already;
but read on—
</p>

<p class="poem">
Spare not to spend, and chiefly there<br />
Where thy desert may merit praise<br />
By ringing in thy lady’s ear.
</p>

<p>
Here he was at a standstill. He could not spend; he could not even dress as a
gentleman. He could not make her rich and beautiful presents.
</p>

<p class="poem">
The strongest castle, tower, and town<br />
The golden bullet beats it down.
</p>

<p>
He had no golden bullets—to him the castle was therefore impregnable.
</p>

<p class="poem">
Serve always with assured trust,<br />
And in thy suit be humble, true—
</p>

<p>
Advice such as this last he could and did follow conscientiously.
</p>

<p class="poem">
Have you not heard it said full oft,<br />
A woman’s nay doth stand for nought?—
</p>

<p>
Encouraging to those who could press the question, but he had not even courage
to get the first nay. It was the “golden bullet”—the lack of
the power to spend—the miserable poverty which pressed upon him with a
leaden weight. He did his best to follow infallible Will’s advice. He
snared twenty hares and sold them; he had still a small gold pencil-case
left—it had belonged to his mother. He sold that also.
</p>

<p>
On foot he walked forty miles to Reading, and spent the whole proceeds in the
purchase of a pair of fine jet bracelets, which his instinct told him would
look well upon Violet’s white wrist. When he had got them, came the
difficulty—how could he give them to her? At last he employed a shepherd
lad to leave a parcel for Miss Waldron.
</p>

<p>
He kept away several days, but love was more powerful than shame. He went.
</p>

<p>
With Violet he strolled up the long shady filbert walk, with the clusters, now
ripe, hanging overhead. His heart beat fast, but he said nothing. On her part
she was silent. Suddenly she lifted up her arm and reached after a cluster of
the nuts high up. Her sleeve fell down; the beautiful arm was bare to the
elbow, and there was the bracelet!
</p>

<p>
Her eyes met his; a lovely colour suffused her cheek. An uncontrollable impulse
seized him. He caught her hand and kissed it. Why linger? No one can tell how
these things come about. Their lips met, and it is enough.
</p>

<p>
That was the happiest autumn Aymer ever knew. Even now he looks back at its
sweetness with a species of regret. The sunshine was warmer, the blue of the
sky richer, the yellow mist that hung over the landscape softer, the bee went
by with a joyous hum, the crimson-and-gold of the dying leaves was more
brilliant than ever it had been before or since. Love lent his palette to
Nature, and the world was aglow with colour. How delicious it is to see
everything through the medium, and in the company of a noble girl just ripening
into womanhood! I remember one such summer—
</p>

<p class="poem">
But age with his stealing steps<br />
Has clawed me in his clutch.
</p>

<p>
She was very beautiful; it is hard to describe her. It was not perhaps so much
the features, the hue of the hair, the colour of the eye, the complexion, or
even the shape, as the life, the vitality, the wonderful freshness which seemed
to throw a sudden light over her, as when the sunshine falls upon a bed of
flowers:—
</p>

<p class="poem">
            Idalian
Aphrodite, beautiful,<br />
Fresh as the foam, new-bathed in Paphian wells,<br />
With rosy, slender fingers backward drew<br />
From her warm brows and bosom, her deep hair<br />
Ambrosial, golden round her lucid throat<br />
And shoulder: from the violets her light foot<br />
Shone rosy-white, and o’er her rounded form<br />
Between the shadows of the vine-bunches<br />
Floated the glowing sunlights as she moved.
</p>

<p>
The modern taste for catalogues compels me to name the colour of her eye and
hair. Her eye was full, large, and lustrous; that deep black so rarely
seen—an eye that gave quick expression to the emotions of the
heart—that flashed with laughter, or melted with tenderness. Her hair was
not quite golden; it was properly brown, but so near the true golden that a
little sunlight lit it up with a glossy radiance impossible to express in
words. The complexion was that lovely mingling of red and white, which the
prince in the fairy tale prayed his lady-love might have, when he saw the
crimson blood of a raven he had slain, staining the translucent marble slab
upon which it had fallen. The nose was nearly straight; the lips full and
scarlet. She was tall, but not too tall. It is difficult for a woman to have a
good carriage unless she be of moderate height. Enough of the catalogue system.
</p>

<p>
They visited all the places in the neighbourhood where Aymer’s pencil
could find a subject. Now it was a grand old beech tree; now only a grey stone,
set up centuries and centuries since as a “stone of memorial” by
races long reduced to ashes; now The Towers, the home of Lady Lechester. With
them always went Dando, Waldron’s favourite dog, a huge mastiff, who
gambolled about in unwieldly antics at Violet’s feet.
</p>

<p>
Aymer listened to her as she played. He sat by the invalid under the shadow of
the sycamore tree near the open window, where he could see her sitting at the
piano, pouring forth the music of Mendelssohn in that peculiar monotonous
cadence which marks the master’s works and fills the mind with a pleasant
melancholy. Now and then her head turned, a glance met his, and then the long
eyelashes drooped again. Presently out she would come with a rush, making old
Dando (short for Dandolo) bound and bark with delight as he raced her round the
green, tearing her flowing dress with his teeth, and whisking away when she
tried to catch him.
</p>

<p>
The grace of her motions, the suppleness of her lithe form, filled
Aymer’s heart with a fierce desire to clasp her waist and devour her
lips, while the invalid laughed aloud at the heavy bounds of his dog. The old
man saw clearly what was going forward, yet he did not put forth his hand to
stay it. They were a happy trio that summer and autumn at World’s End.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Three.</h3>

<p>
The summer passed away, as all things do, the winter, and the spring blossomed
afresh, and still the course of true love ran smooth with Aymer and Violet.
</p>

<p>
The winter had been only one degree less pleasant than the summer. Violet had a
beautiful voice; Aymer’s was not nearly so fine: still, it was fairly
good, and scarcely an evening passed without duets and solos on the pianoforte,
while old Waldron, animated for the time beyond his wont, accompanied them upon
the violin. He had an instrument which, next to his daughter and his dog Dando,
he valued above all things. It was by Guarnerius, and he handled it with more
care than a mother does her infant, expatiating upon the quality of the wood,
the sycamore and pine, the beauty of the varnish, the peculiar, inimitable curl
of the scroll, which had genius in its very twist.
</p>

<p>
Aymer was a ready listener. In the first place, he had grown to look upon
Waldron in the light that he would have regarded an affectionate and beneficent
father. Then he was, above all things, anxious to please Violet, and he knew
that she adored the Silver Fleece, as she called him, in laughing allusion to
his odd Christian name, Jason, and to his grey hairs. And, lastly, he really
did feel a curiosity and a desire to learn.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes Aymer gave Violet lessons in drawing, and she repaid him with lessons
in French and music, being proficient in both.
</p>

<p>
After a while Waldron discovered that this boy, without means or friends, had
made himself acquainted with the classics, and had even journeyed as a pilgrim
to the shrines of ancient art at Florence.
</p>

<p>
At this he was highly pleased. He at once set to work to ground Aymer in the
original languages in which Plato and Livy wrote. He taught him to appreciate
the delicate allusions, and exquisite turn of diction, of Horace. He corrected
the crude ideas which the self-instructed student had formed, and opened to him
the wide field of modern criticism. The effect upon Aymer’s mind was most
beneficial, and the old man, while teaching the youth, felt his heart, already
predisposed, yearning towards him more and more.
</p>

<p>
To Violet this was especially a happy omen, for she, above all things, loved
her only parent, and had not ceased to fear lest her affection for Aymer should
be met by his disapproval. As time went on, the ties of intimacy still further
strengthened.
</p>

<p>
Waldron was now often seen in deep thought, and left the young people more to
themselves. He busied himself with pen and ink, with calculations and figures,
to the subject-matter of which he did not ask their attention.
</p>

<p>
Even yet Aymer had not thought of marriage; even yet he had not overcome his
constitutional sensitiveness so much as to contemplate such a possibility. It
was enough to dwell in the sunshine of her presence. Thoroughly happy in her
love, he never thought of to-morrow. Perhaps it is a matter to be regretted
that we cannot always remain in this state—ever enjoying the ideal
without approaching nearer to the realisation, for the realisation, let it be
never so glorious, is of the earth, earthy.
</p>

<p>
It is quite true that women like courage, and that boldness often goes a long
way; but it is questionable whether with high-bred natures a subdued, quiet,
and delicate manner does not go still further. Aymer was incapable of
self-laudation, of that detestable conceit which some think it proper to show
when they have made what they are pleased to call “a conquest.”
Pity the poor castles that have stooped to them!
</p>

<p>
His happiness had but one alloy—the perpetual remembrance of his own
unworthiness, the immeasurable difference in his worldly position, which made
it a presumption in him even to frequent her presence, much less to bask in her
love. There were plenty who did not fail to remind him of this discrepancy in
their mutual positions, for his intimacy at The Place could not, of course,
pass unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
Martin Brown said nothing whatever. If there was any alteration in his manner
as the truth dawned on him, it was in favour of Aymer. With such men everything
is judged by results. While Aymer went about sketching alone, he despised him
and his pencil; the moment the very same talent obtained him the notice of
those in a superior station, then Aymer was do longer such a fool. Martin said
nothing. He refrained from his former jeers, and abstained from telling Aymer
to go and mind the sheep.
</p>

<p>
It was also to his advantage that Aymer should get rich acquaintances, and so
possibly obtain a livelihood, and relieve him of an expense, which, however
small, was always a bitter subject with him.
</p>

<p>
But there were others—farmers’ sons—in the district who did
not spare Aymer. They despised him; they could not understand him; and they
hated him for his luck in carrying off the squire’s daughter. They
credited him with the most mercenary motives, and called him a beggarly
upstart. If Aymer chanced to pass near them he was saluted with ironical bows
and cheers, and hats were obsequiously doffed to “My Lord Muck,” or
“My Lord Would-Be.”
</p>

<p>
He made no reply, but the insult went home. He knew that there was a great deal
of ground for this treatment. He knew that his conduct must appear in such a
light to others; and yet how welcome they always made him at The Place. He
questioned himself if he was doing right; sometimes his pride said “Go;
carve yourself a fortune, and then return for her;” but love, strong love
always conquered and drove him forward. He deemed that, with the exception of
Violet and Waldron, all the world looked upon him with contempt. He was wrong.
</p>

<p>
In the spring, Violet began to ride again over the Downs. This habit for a
moment again lowered Aymer in his own estimation, for he had no horse to
accompany her. What was his delight and astonishment when one day Violet took
him to the stables and asked him how he liked the new grey horse. It was a
handsome animal—Aymer admired it, as in duty bound, and as, indeed, he
could not help, yet with a heart full of mortification, when Violet whispered
that papa had bought it for him to ride with her. She flung her arms, in her
own impulsive way, round his neck, kissed him, and rushed away to don her
riding-habit before he could recover from his astonishment.
</p>

<p>
It was true. In an hour’s time they were galloping over the soft springy
turf of the Downs, trying the paces of the grey, who proved faster than the
black. The rides were repeated day by day; and it often happened that, while
thus enjoying themselves, they passed one or more of those very persons who had
so often insulted Aymer.
</p>

<p>
Instead of sitting firmer and with pride in his saddle, Aymer felt that he all
the more deserved their censure, and looked the other way as he went by.
</p>

<p>
He did not know that there was one eye at least that watched him with pleasure,
and with something like a quiet envy. It was the same grey eye that had
observed, him in the Palazzo at Florence.
</p>

<p>
Agnes Lechester had returned to England to spend some time at the old Towers,
and had not failed to make inquiries for the young pilgrim who, in coarse garb,
she had seen at the shrine of art. She heard of the intimacy with Waldron, whom
she had once or twice spoken to; and as the lovers rode slowly beneath her
grand and comfortless home, she sat at her window, and paused in her art-work,
and looked down upon them and sighed. She could not but envy them their joy and
youth, their path strewn with roses and lighted by love. She had no need to
envy Violet’s beauty, for, although no longer young, Agnes Lechester was
a fine woman. It was the life, the full glowing life, she deemed so desirable.
And she rejoiced that the poor pilgrim had found so fair a lady-love. So that
there was one eye at least which, unknown to Aymer, watched him with a quiet
pleasure and approval. Had he known it, it would have encouraged him greatly.
By precipitating matters it might have prevented—but let us proceed.
</p>

<p>
Jason Waldron knew that his daughter loved, and was beloved. He was no ordinary
man. His life had been spent far from those money-making centres where, in
time, the best of natures loses its original bias, and sees nothing but gold.
Age, he believed, had given him some power of penetration; and in Aymer he
thought he had found one in a thousand—one with whom his darling
daughter’s future would be safe. “He will not follow the universal
idol,” thought the old man. “He will be content with art and
literature, with nature and with Violet. I can see nothing in store for them
but the happiest of lives.” He waited long, expecting Aymer to approach
the subject in some distant manner. At last he comprehended his reluctance.
“He is poor and proud—he is afraid, and no wonder,” he
thought. “He shall not suffer for that.”
</p>

<p>
The benevolent old man, anxious only to complete the happiness of those he
loved, resolved to be the first, and to hold out a welcoming hand. One day he
called for Aymer to his study, and motioning him to a seat, averted his face,
not to confuse him, and said that he had long seen the mutual affection between
Violet and him. He understood why Aymer had refrained from taking him into his
confidence—he could appreciate the difficulties of his position. Without
any hesitation, he approved of Violet’s choice. His own years had now
begun to weigh upon him, and he grew daily more anxious that Violet should be
settled. He proposed, therefore, that if Aymer would not mind the arrangement,
they should be united as speedily as possible, and that after a short trip they
should return and live with him at The Place. He could not spare Violet
entirely—he must hear the sound of her voice, and see the light of her
eyes, while yet the power to do so remained with him. He was not really rich.
In that poor district, indeed, he appeared so, but it was only by comparison.
Were he to be placed in some great city, side by side with the men whose trade
was gold, his little all would sink into the utmost insignificance. Beside rude
rustics, who lived from hand to mouth, content if they paid the rent, and
perhaps put by a hundred guineas in the county bant, he was well off; but not
when weighed against the world.
</p>

<p>
He had but the house he dwelt in, a few acres of surrounding pasture, and three
thousand pounds placed out on loan. This money brought in a good interest, but
he had lately thought of calling it in for greater safety, as he felt himself
to be getting old in every sense of the term.
</p>

<p>
It was obvious, therefore, that on the score of expense alone it would be
difficult for him to give a dower to Violet sufficient to support a second
home. If they could be happy with him, why he should be content.
</p>

<p>
He turned and held out his hand to Aymer. Aymer took it, but could say nothing.
He was literally overwhelmed. To him, after so long a solitude, after so much
contempt, this marvellous good fortune was overpowering. Jason pretended not to
notice his confusion.
</p>

<p>
“We understand one another,” he said. “It is agreed, is it
not?”
</p>

<p>
Despite all his attempts, Aymer could but incline his head.
</p>

<p>
“It is a lovely day—take Violet for a ride to Berbury camp.”
</p>

<p>
How Aymer managed to convey what had passed to Violet he never knew, but that
was the longest ride they ever had together, and it was dark before The Place
was reached.
</p>

<p>
Aymer did not go home after quitting Violet. He walked away upon the Downs
until safe from observation, then threw himself upon the sward, and poured out
his heart in thanksgiving. When he had grown a little calmer he leant against a
beech-trunk and gazed at the stars. In that short hour upon the solitary Downs
he lived a whole lifetime of happiness. There are some of us who can remember
such hours—they occur but once to any human being.
</p>

<p>
To do the rough residents of the district justice, so soon as it was understood
to be settled that they were to be married, then the tone of the place changed,
and they no longer insulted and annoyed him. Some wished him joy and happiness:
not without a tinge of envy at his good fortune, expressed in the rude language
of the hills, “I wish I had thee luck, lad.”
</p>

<p>
It was generally agreed that when the marriage took place there should be an
arch erected and decorated with flowers, for the bride and bridegroom to pass
under; that the path through the churchyard should be strewn with roses, that
volleys of firearms should be discharged, and the day kept as a holiday. This
was settled at the Shepherd’s Bush over foaming jugs of ale.
</p>

<p>
“Arter all,” said an old fellow, “he bean’t such a bad
sort o’ chap. A’ mind a’ tuk a main bit o’ trouble
loike to pull a ewe o’ mine out of a ditch where hur laid on hur
back.”
</p>

<p>
“Ay, ay!” said another; “and a’ drawed my little Kittie
on the kitchen wall wi’ a bit o’ charcoal as natural as ever hur
walked—zo let’s gie ’un a rouser, chaps, and no
mistake!”
</p>

<p>
This was how it happened that at World’s End Races that fateful year,
early in October, a delicate-looking young man, commonly dressed, stood beside
the pretty pony-carriage under the hawthorn tree. The marriage was fixed for
that day week.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Four.</h3>

<p>
The marriage would have taken place earlier but for two circumstances: first,
the difficulty of obtaining the wedding outfit for Violet in that
out-of-the-way place; and secondly, because Jason insisted upon some important
alterations being made in the old house, in order to render it more comfortable
for his children.
</p>

<p>
There is no event in life which causes so much discussion, such pleasant
anticipation, as the marriage-day; and at The Place there was not a single
thing left unmentioned; every detail of the ceremony was talked over, and it
was a standing joke of Jason’s to tell Violet to study her prayer-book, a
remark that never failed to make the blood mount to her forehead.
</p>

<p>
She grew somewhat pensive as the final moment approached—with all her
youth and spirits, with all the happy omens that accompanied the course of her
love, she could not view this, the most important step she would ever take,
always with thoughtless levity. She became silent and thoughtful, gave up
riding, and devoted herself almost exclusively to attending upon Jason, till
Aymer—silly fellow!—grew jealous, and declared it was unkind of her
to look forward to the wedding-day as if it was a sentence of imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
Mr Waldron had lived so retired that there was some little difficulty in fixing
upon a representative to give Violet away, for as an invalid he could not
himself go to the church; and this was the only thing he was heard to
regret—that he should not see Violet married. However, he consoled
himself with the thought that he should see her immediately afterwards, as the
church was hardly half a mile distant, down in a narrow combe or valley. After
some reflection, Mr Waldron decided upon asking his solicitor, Mr Merton, of
Barnham, to act as his representative and give the bride away.
</p>

<p>
Merton, who was an old bachelor, was really delighted at the idea, but with
true professional mendacity made an immense virtue of the sacrifice of time it
entailed. He really was so busy with a great law case just coming on that
really—but then his old friend Waldron, and lovely Miss Violet—duty
pulled him one way and inclination another, and beauty, as was proper,
triumphed.
</p>

<p>
Violet had few acquaintances, and it was more difficult still to find her a
bridesmaid—not that there were not plenty ready to fill that onerous
post—but she disliked the idea of a stranger. Mr Merton, the solicitor,
solved the difficulty by suggesting a niece of his, a merry girl whom Violet
had met once or twice.
</p>

<p>
Aymer could not do less than ask old Martin Brown to stand as his best man,
never dreaming that he would accept the task. But what was his surprise when
Martin declared that he should enjoy the fun, and would rather miss Barnham
fair than not be there. He came out tolerably handsome for him; he offered
Aymer a five-pound note to purchase a suitable dress! This note Aymer very
respectfully declined to take, and the farmer, half repenting of his
generosity, did not press him too hard. Yet he could not help expressing his
wonder as to how Aymer meant to appear at church. “Thee bisn’t
a-goin’ to marry th’ squire’s darter in thee ould hat?”
</p>

<p>
Aymer smiled and said nothing. Fortune had aided him in this way too. After
endless disappointments and “returned with thanks,” he had suddenly
received a cheque for a sketch of his which had been accepted by an illustrated
paper. Immediately afterwards came another cheque for a short story accepted by
a magazine. This success, small as it was, elated him, if anything, more than
the approaching marriage-day. He had tried, and tried, and tried, and failed
again and again, till he despaired and ceased to make the attempt, till the
necessity of obtaining some clothes drove him to the last desperate venture. He
was elated beyond measure. A successful author, a successful artist, and just
about to marry the most beautiful woman in the world!
</p>

<p>
He resolved to tell Violet nothing about it, but to show her the sketch and the
story as they were upon their trip. Thus it was that he was independent of
Martini grudging generosity. Fortune did not stop even here. As if determined
to shower delight upon him—to make up at one blow for the cruel
isolation, the miserable restraint he had undergone—she never seemed to
tire of opening up fresh vistas of pleasure. Both Violet and Aymer would have
been satisfied, and more than satisfied, with a simple visit to the seaside;
but Jason was not so easily pleased. His daughter was his life—nothing
was too good for her—and, besides, such an event happened but once in a
lifetime, and it was fit and proper that it be accompanied with memorable
circumstances. He announced his intention of sending his children to Florence.
</p>

<p>
To Florence, the beautiful city, which dwelt for ever in Aymer’s
dreams—the city he had described time after time to Violet, till the girl
thought it the finest upon earth. He was to revisit Florence, and to revisit it
with Violet! His heart was full—it would have been impossible to add
another blessing.
</p>

<p>
Violet raced about the house and the garden, teasing Dando to
distraction—all her pensiveness dispelled, murmuring
“Florence” at every turn. What further joy could there be in
store?—it was impossible. It is almost safe to say that these two were
the happiest in England. Well they might be. They had all upon their
side—i.e., youth.
</p>

<p>
Violet was to be married upon her twenty-first birthday; Aymer was twenty-three
only. Money—not riches—but sufficient for an easy life. Italy in
view—the land of the artist and the poet! It was like a fairy dream!
</p>

<p>
The days flew by. The dresses came—oh, what eager discussions and
conferences there were over the dresses! All the farmers’ daughters and
wives in the neighbourhood to whom Violet was even distantly known, claimed the
privilege to see the trousseau. In London it would have been
overlooked—there all things are upon a grand scale.
</p>

<p>
At World’s End the ladies were never tired of descanting upon the glories
of the silk and satin, the lace and tulle. How can a wretched, unsympathising
man describe the sensation produced by Violet’s wedding outfit?
</p>

<p>
The dear girl was in ecstasies. Waldron had gone to the utmost limit of his
purse—his friend Merton even frowned a little—but he argued it was
only for once—just this once—he must be permitted a little
extravagance on Violet’s marriage-day.
</p>

<p>
Aymer was again plagued with his old tormentors—they did not sneer or
jeer at him, but he had to run the gauntlet of rude jokes and rustic wit. He
forgave them, and asked as many as he could to the breakfast.
</p>

<p>
The breakfast was to be laid out in that very apartment the window of which
opened upon the garden near the sycamore tree, where he had sat so many times
listening to Violet playing upon the pianoforte. There was of course a cake,
and there was to be what had never before been seen or tasted at World’s
End from time immemorial—i.e., several dozens of champagne.
</p>

<p>
If the wedding outfit caused a sensation among the ladies, this champagne was
all the talk among the men. They thought of nothing else—it was the
subject of endless allusions and unabating anticipation. Here and there was one
who could say he had tasted the wine—when after a good hunting spin Lord
So-and-So had asked the sportsmen to refresh themselves at his mansion. But the
majority had not the faintest notion of what it was like, and formed the most
fantastic expectations. There were a few who doubted whether there would be any
champagne, and treated it as a myth, till the servants at The Place, proud of
their importance, admitted some favoured individuals who were regaled in secret
with—the taste?—no, but the view only of certain tall bottles
dressed in rosy tissue paper, upon the removal of which stood out the far-famed
silver-foil, and doubt was no more. World’s End was full of its first
champagne treat.
</p>

<p>
Old Martin Brown swelled up into a person of enormous importance, as being the
nearest relative of the bridegroom; he was looked upon as an oracle, and his
remarks listened to with intense interest at the nightly tobacco parliament at
the Shepherd’s Bush.
</p>

<p>
The carriers took fabulous reports of what was to happen at World’s End
all over the district, and scores of honest people made up their minds to
trudge to Bury Wick Church.
</p>

<p>
Aymer was no longer knocked up at five in the morning, as was the custom, to
breakfast at six. He was undisturbed. No more jeers and contempt—he was
treated with deference. “My nevvy” was a success; Martin spoke of
his “nevvy” as if the connection did him honour.
</p>

<p>
I hope among the readers of this history there will be many ladies who can
remember their feelings on the approach of the marriage-day. Let them kindly
recall those moments of wild excitement, of trepidation lest some accident
should happen, of a half-hesitation, of a desire to plunge at once and get it
over—and approximately they will understand Violet’s heart.
</p>

<p>
Even yet Fortune had not exhausted her favours. On the morning of World’s
End Races, just one short week before the day, there came a letter in an
unknown handwriting, addressed to Aymer Malet, Esq, enclosing five ten-pound
notes from an anonymous donor, who wished him every felicity, and advised him
to persevere in his art studies.
</p>

<p>
This extraordinary gift, so totally unexpected, filled Aymer with astonishment.
It seemed as if it had dropped from the skies, for he had not the remotest
suspicion that Lady Lechester was watching him with interest.
</p>

<p>
At last the day came. Violet was awake at the earliest dawn, and saw the sun
rise, clear and cloudless, from the window. It was one of those days which
sometimes occur in autumn, with all the beauty and warmth of summer, without
its burning heat, and made still more delicious by the sensation of idle
drowsiness—a day for lotos eating. The beech trees already showed an
orange tint in places; the maples were turning scarlet; the oaks had a trace of
buff. The rooks lazily cawed as they flew off with the acorns, the hills were
half hidden with a yellowy vapour, and a few distant fleecy clouds, far up,
floated in the azure. A dream-like, luxurious day, such as happens but once a
year!
</p>

<p>
Violet was up with the sun—how could she rest? Miss Merton was with her,
chatting gaily. Oh, the mysteries of the toilet! my feeble pen must leave that
topic to imagination. All I can say is, that it seemed as if it never would be
completed, notwithstanding the reiterated warnings of Jason that the time was
going fast.
</p>

<p>
There came one more pleasant surprise.
</p>

<p>
A strange man on horseback was seen riding up to The Place. This was so rare an
event that Violet’s heart beat fast, fearing lest even at the eleventh
hour something should happen to cause delay. She waited; her hands trembled.
Even the delicious toilet had to be suspended.
</p>

<p>
Footsteps came up the staircase, and then the maidservant, bearing in her hand
a small parcel, advanced to Miss Waldron. With trembling fingers she cut the
string—it was a delicate casket of mother-of-pearl. The key was in it;
she opened the lid, and an involuntary exclamation of surprise and admiration
burst from her lips.
</p>

<p>
There lay the loveliest necklace of pearls that ever the sun had shone upon.
Rich, costly pearls—pearls that were exactly fitted above all jewels for
her—pearls that she had always wished for—pearls! They were round
her neck in a moment.
</p>

<p>
Miss Merton was in raptures; the maidservant lost her wits, and ran downstairs
calling every one to go up and see Miss Vi’let “in them
shiners!”
</p>

<p>
For a while, in the surprise and wonder, the donor had been forgotten. Under
the necklace was a delicate pink note, offering Lady Lechester’s sincere
desire that Miss Waldron would long wear her little present, and wishing her
every good thing. When the wedding trip was over, would <i>Mrs</i> Aymer Malet
let her know that she might call?
</p>

<p>
Violet was not perfect any more than other girls; she had naturally a vein of
pride; she did feel no little elation at this auspicious mark of attention and
regard from a person in Lady Lechester’s position. The rank of the donor
added to the value of the gift.
</p>

<p>
Mr Waldron was much affected by this token of esteem. He could not express his
pleasure to the giver, because her messenger had galloped off the moment he had
delivered the parcel. The importance of the bride, great enough before,
immediately rose ninety per cent, in the eyes of Miss Merton, and a hundred and
fifty per cent, in the eyes of the lower classes.
</p>

<p>
Mr Waldron, examining the pearls with the eye of a connoisseur, valued them at
the very lowest at two hundred guineas. The involuntary tears of the poor
pilgrim at the shrine of art had indeed solidified into gems!
</p>

<p>
The news flew over the adjacent village of Bury Wick; the servants at The Place
spread it abroad, and in ten minutes it was known far and wide. The excitement
was intense. Champagne was grand enough—but pearls! World’s End
went wild! Champagne and pearls in one day! The whole place turned out to give
the bride a triumphant reception.
</p>

<p>
Aymer was forgotten in the excitement over Violet: forgotten, but not by the
bride. All she wished was to be able to show him her present—but
etiquette forbade his being sent for on that particular morning; he must meet
her at the church.
</p>

<p>
At the church—goodness! these pearls had delayed the toilet, and ten
o’clock had struck. At eleven—ah! at eleven!
</p>

<p>
Mr Merton had not arrived yet. He had arranged to bring his carriage; at The
Place they had nothing grander than the pony-carriage. Mr Merton, anxious to do
the thing well, as he expressed it, had sent word that he should bring his
carriage and pair of greys, to take the bride to the church.
</p>

<p>
From the earliest dawn the bells at Bury Church had been going from time to
time; and every now and then there was a scattered fire of musketry, like
skirmishing; it was the young farmers and their friends arriving with their
guns, and saluting.
</p>

<p>
But at a quarter-past ten there was a commotion. The bells burst out merrier
than ever; there was volley after volley of musketry, and cheering which
penetrated even to the chamber of the bride, where she sat before the mirror
with the pearls round her neck. It was Merton driving up in style, with his
greys decorated with wedding favours.
</p>

<p>
Bang! clang! shout, and hurrah! The hand from Barnham struck up. “See the
Conquering Hero comes!” There never was such a glorious day before or
since at World’s End.
</p>

<p>
“Nevvy,” said old Martin, already a little warm, and slapping Aymer
on the back, “nevvy, my buoy! Thee bist th’ luckiest dog in
Inglandt—champagne and purls—Ha! ha! ha!”
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Five.</h3>

<p>
There was an attempt at order, but it was an utter failure. The men came
crowding after Merton’s carriage shouting and firing guns, the horses
snorted, and when Violet glanced from the window, the excitement of the scene
made her hesitate and draw back.
</p>

<p>
Merton—a regular <i>lady’s bachelor</i>, so to say—was equal
to the occasion; it was not the first at which he had assisted. He at once
became the soul of the ceremonies. He congratulated Waldron, hastened
everybody, went into the apartment where the breakfast was laid out, and with
his own hands re-arranged it to his satisfaction, shouting out all the time to
the bride to make haste.
</p>

<p>
She came at last. How few brides look well in their wedding-dresses. Even girls
who are undeniably handsome fail to stand the trying ordeal; but Violet was so
happy, so radiant, she could not help but appear to the best advantage.
</p>

<p>
Poor old Jason’s lip quivered as he gazed at his girl’s
face—for the last time as <i>his</i>—his lip quivered, and the
words of his blessing would not come; his throat swelled, and a tear gathered
in his eye. She bent and kissed him, turned and crossed the threshold.
</p>

<p>
Waldron wheeled himself to the large open window, and watched her walk to the
carriage along the carpet, put down that her feet might not touch the ground.
</p>

<p>
Who shall presume to analyse the feelings of that proud and happy old man? The
carriage moved, the crowd shouted, the guns fired; he wheeled his chair a
little round, and his head leant forward. Was he thinking of a day twenty-two
years ago, when he—not a young man, but still full of hope—led
another fair bride to the altar; a bride who had long since left him?
</p>

<p>
It was an ovation—a triumph all the way along that short half-mile to the
church: particularly as they entered the village. The greys pranced slowly,
lifting their hoofs well up, champing the bit, proud of their burden. The bride
and Miss Merton sat on one seat, Mr Merton on the other. All the men and boys
and children, all the shepherds and ploughboys for miles and miles, who had
gathered together, set up a shout. The bells rang merrily, the guns popped and
banged, handkerchiefs were waved. Across the village street, but a few yards
from the churchyard lych-gate, they had erected an arch—as had been
determined on at the Shepherd’s Bush—an arch that would have done
credit to more pretentious places, with the motto, “Joy be with
you.”
</p>

<p>
The bride dismounted at the lych-gate, which was itself covered with flowers,
and set her foot upon the scarlet cloth which the good old vicar had himself
provided, and which was laid down right to the porch.
</p>

<p>
The churchyard was full of children, chiefly girls, all carrying roses and
flowers to strew the path of the happy couple when they emerged united. In the
porch the ringers stood, four on each side, with their hands upon the ropes
ready to clash forth the news that the deed was done. The old old clerk was
there, in his black suit, which had done duty on so many occasions.
</p>

<p>
She entered the little church—small, but extremely ancient. She passed
the antique font, her light footstep pressed upon the recumbent brazen image of
a knight of other days. The venerable vicar advanced to meet her, the sunshine
falling on his grey head. But where was Aymer? Surely all must be well: but she
could not see him—not for the moment. True-hearted, loving Violet had
looked for Aymer with his old battered hat, in the corduroy trousers and the
green coat she had known him in so long.
</p>

<p>
For the moment she barely recognised the handsome, gentlemanly man before her.
It was Aymer—oh yes, it was Aymer—and how noble he looked now that
he was dressed as became him. Her heart gave another bound of
joy—involuntarily she stepped forward; what could be wanting to complete
her happiness that day? Certainly it would have been hard to have named one
single thing as lacking—not one. The pews were full of women of all
classes—they had been mostly reserved for them—the men finding
standing room as best they could; and a buzz of admiration went round the
church as Violet came into fall view. Her dress was good—it was nothing
to belles who flourish in Belgravia; but at World’s End—goodness,
it was Paris itself.
</p>

<p>
That costume formed the one great topic of conversation for years afterwards. I
know nothing of these things; but Miss Merton told me a few days ago that the
bride wore a wreath of white rosebuds and myrtle upon her lovely head, and a
veil of real Brussels lace. Her earrings were of rubies and diamonds—a
present that morning from gallant Mr Merton. She had a plain locket (with a
portrait of Waldron), and wore the splendid necklace of pearls, the gift of
Lady Lechester.
</p>

<p>
Her dress was white satin, trimmed with Brussels lace, and her feet were shod
in satin boots. Of course the “rosy, slender fingers” were cased in
the traditional white kid, and around her wrist was a bracelet of solid dull
gold—the bridegroom’s present, only delivered just as she stepped
into the carriage. She carried a bouquet of stephanotis, orange, and myrtle.
</p>

<p>
It is very likely I have misunderstood Miss Merton’s lively description,
but I think that the above was something like it. Miss Merton herself wore a
white silk trimmed with turquoise, blue, a gold locket with monogram in
turquoise and pearls, and earrings to match—a gift from Mr
Waldron—and a bouquet, I think, chiefly of white roses and jessamine.
</p>

<p>
It was a lovely sight. The sunshine fell upon the bride as she advanced up the
aisle—fell upon her through the antique panes which softened and mellowed
the light. Never did a fairer bride mount the chancel steps.
</p>

<p>
Aymer waited for her. Till now Violet had been comparatively calm; but now,
face to face with the clergyman robed in white, near to the altar and its holy
associations, as the first tones of his sonorous voice fell upon her ear, what
wonder that her knees trembled and the blood forsook her cheek. Aymer
surreptitiously, and before he had a right in etiquette to do so, touched her
hand gently—it strengthened and revived her; she blushed slightly, and
the vicar’s voice, as he gazed upon her beauty, involuntarily softened
and fell. While his lips uttered the oft-repeated words, so known by heart that
the book in his hand was unneeded, his soul offered up a prayer that this fair
creature—yes, just this one—should be spared those pains and
miseries which were ordained upon the human race.
</p>

<p>
The flag upon the church tower waved in the gentle breeze; the children were
marshalled beside the path in two long rows, with their hands full of flowers;
the women in the cottages were hunting up the old slippers and shoes; the men
looked to the caps upon the nipples of their guns; the handsome greys snorted
at the gate; and the grand old sun, above all, bathed the village in a flood of
light. I cannot linger over it longer.
</p>

<p>
The solemn adjuration was put, the question asked, and Aymer in an audible
voice replied, “I will.” The still more solemn adjuration to the
woman was repeated—it is but a few words, but it conveys a world of
meaning, it sums up a lifetime—and Violet’s answer was upon her
lips, when, before she could form the words, the chancel side-door burst open,
and there—
</p>

<p>
There before her very eyes, before the bride to whom that day was consecrated,
who for that one day was by all law human and divine to be kept from all
miserable things, there stood an awe-struck, gasping man, whose white
shirt-front was one broad sheet of crimson blood.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to gather together, from the confused narratives of those who
were present, what really happened in consecutive order, but this is nearly it.
Not only was his shirt-front blood, but his grey hair and partially bald head
were spotted that awful red, and his trembling hands dripped—the blood
literally dripped from them on to the stone pavement. For one awful moment
there was a pause—utter silence. The man staggered forward and said in
broken tones, but audible over the whole church—
</p>

<p>
“Miss Violet; your father is <i>dead</i>!” And the bride dropped
like a stone before Aymer at her side, or Merton just behind, could grasp her
arm. She was down upon the cold stone floor, her wedding-dress all crumpled up,
her wreath fallen off, the light of life and love gone from her eyes, the happy
glow from her cheek. Even in that moment the clergyman’s heart smote him.
His impious prayer! That this one because of her beauty should be
spared—and struck down before his very eyes in the midst of her joy and
triumph. All that they could see in the body of the church was a shapeless heap
of satin where but a moment before had stood the most envied of them all.
</p>

<p>
Aymer knelt and lifted her head; it lay helpless upon his hands. As he did so
the wedding-ring, which he had ready, slipped unnoticed from his grasp and was
lost. When it was missed, days afterwards, and a search was instituted, it
could not be found, and this the superstitious treasured up as a remarkable
fact.
</p>

<p>
Merton raised her up; her frame was limp and helpless in their arms. They
carried her to the vestry and brought water. Miss Merton, trembling as she was,
did not faint; but, good, brave girl, did her best.
</p>

<p>
In the excitement over the bride, even the man who had brought this awful news
was for the moment forgotten. When they looked for him he was leaning against
the altar-rails, as if about to fall, and some of the blood was spotted on the
sacred altar-cloth. The men rushed at him; the women, afraid, held back and
watched what new harm must come. They deemed that it was some horrible
creature; they could not believe that it was only the old gardener at The
Place—Waldron’s oldest servant.
</p>

<p>
Only the gardener. He was as helpless as themselves. He had over-exerted
himself running to the church with his dreadful tidings, and being subject to
heart disease, he could barely stand, and only gasp out that “Master was
killed, and quite dead!”
</p>

<p>
The men, finding nothing could be got from him, ran out, and made direct for
The Place. Some leapt on their horses, but those on foot crossing the meadow,
as the gardener had done, got there first. All the men made for The
Place—all the women stayed to see what would become of the bride.
</p>

<p>
It was a dead faint, but it was not long before she came to, and immediately
insisted upon being taken home. They would have detained her in the vestry till
at least confirmation of the dreadful intelligence had arrived. But no, she
begged and prayed them to take her; and fearing lest uncertainty should do more
harm than certainty, they half-led, half-carried her from the church.
</p>

<p>
There was not a dry eye among the sympathising women who had remained—not
one among those rude, half-educated people whose heart was not bursting with
sorrow for the poor shrinking form that was borne through their midst.
</p>

<p>
But a few short moments since, and how proud and happy had she been advancing
up the aisle! The children were gone from the churchyard; their flowers cast
away, not in the pathway of the bride, but on the graves. In their haste, they
had trod upon the scarlet cloth laid down, and discoloured and stained it. The
ringers had deserted the bell-ropes, the village street was empty and
silent—only the unconscious flag waved upon the tower, and the arch stood
for them to pass beneath, with its motto—now a bitter
mockery—“Joy be with you!”
</p>

<p>
The carriage rolled along the road, and as they approached The Place, Merton
began to recover his professional calm; and the return of his mind to a more
normal state was marked by doubt—Was it true?
</p>

<p>
But no sooner had they entered the garden than he saw it was. The faces of the
knots of men, their low, hushed voices, all told but one tale—death had
been there!
</p>

<p>
They tried to get Violet to go upstairs to her own room, but she would not.
“I must see him!” was her cry. “I must see him!”
</p>

<p>
She pushed through them. All gave way before her. Not <i>there</i>, surely?
Yes, there—in the very room where the wedding-breakfast was laid out,
where the cake stood upon the table, and the champagne-bottles at the side;
there, in the place of joy, was the dead—dead in his armchair, close to
the window, with a ghastly wound upon the once-peaceful brow!
</p>

<p>
She threw up her hands—she uttered a great cry. Those that heard it say
it rings even now in their ears. She threw herself upon him. The crimson blood
dyed her veil, as it hung loose and torn, and tinged the innocent pearls around
her neck with its terrible hue. She fainted the second time, and would have
fallen, but Aymer caught her; and they bore her upstairs, unconscious even of
her misery.
</p>

<p>
The Place was silent. The guns were not fired, the bells were stilled. Men
moved with careful footsteps, women hushed their voices, and in the stillness
they heard the church clock slowly striking the hour of noon. At that moment
she should have been returning, radiant and blissful in triumph, to meet the
welcome from her father’s lips.
</p>

<p>
There was one that could not understand it—one dumb beast that could not
be driven away. It was Dando, the mastiff dog. Strangely enough, he avoided the
chamber of the dead, and crouched at the door of Violet’s room.
</p>

<p>
When Merton saw it he said, “Let the dog go in; maybe, he will relieve
her a little.”
</p>

<p>
But Violet, lying on a couch, conscious now and tearless, despairing in the
darkened room, motioned him away. “Take him away,” she said.
“If he had been faithful, he would have watched and guarded.”
</p>

<p>
It was a natural thought, but it was not just. Poor Dando, like the rest, had
gone to the church with the crowd; and just at the moment when he was most
wanted, then he was absent from his duty.
</p>

<p>
The great sun still bathed the village in a flood of light, the fleecy clouds
sailed slowly in the azure, the yellow mist hung over the distant hills, and
the leaves now and again rustled to the ground. But the chamber that should
have resounded with laughter and joy was darkened. One more human leaf had
fallen from the earthly tree of life. Once more those that were left behind
were worse off than those that were taken. In the words of the dear old
ballad—
</p>

<p class="poem">
My summer’s day, in lusty May,<br />
Is darked afore the noon.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Six.</h3>

<p>
Great horror fell upon the whole neighbourhood of World’s End. Not the
oldest man or woman could remember such a deed in their midst. Hitherto the
spectre of Murder had avoided those grand old hills. There was no memory of
such a thing. The nearest approach to it, which the gossips at the
Shepherd’s Bush could recall to mind, had happened long before the days
of the oldest of them all.
</p>

<p>
There was one, and one only, who declared that in his youth his father left him
in charge of the hayfield one beautiful summer’s day, to go and see a man
hung on the gallows. It was the custom then to erect the gallows at, or very
near, the spot where the crime was supposed to have been committed; often at
the cross roads.
</p>

<p>
His father told him—and having heard the tale so often it was still fresh
in his memory—that the gallows in this case was built in a narrow lane,
close to a gateway, through which the murderer had fired the fatal shot at his
victim. The spot was known to that day as Deadman’s Gate.
</p>

<p>
There was an immense crowd collected to witness the execution, and the sun
shone brilliantly on the ghastly machine. The murderer, as seems to have been
the fashion in those times, at the foot of the gallows declared his innocence;
and there were not wanting people who, in despite of the evidence, believed
him.
</p>

<p>
Just after the horrible ceremony was finished, and the lifeless body swung to
and fro, there burst a thunderstorm upon the crowd, which scattered in all
directions.
</p>

<p>
Two men took refuge under a tall tree. One said, “This is
dangerous,” and went out into the field; before the other could follow he
was struck dead by the lightning, so that there were now two corpses.
</p>

<p>
This man chanced to be one of the principal witnesses against the murderer, and
superstition firmly believed that the thunderstorm marked the Divine wrath at
the execution of an innocent man.
</p>

<p>
“The moment before,” said the narrator, “the sky was
perfectly clear; the storm came without the slightest warning.” The fact
being that the crowd were so intent upon the spectacle before them that they
had not noticed the gathering clouds.
</p>

<p>
“Ay,” concluded the narrator, who evidently shared in the
superstition, “it be an awful thing to bear witness about blood. There be
them about here as I wouldn’t stand in their shoes!”
</p>

<p>
A dead silence followed. Men understood what he meant. Already public suspicion
had fallen upon the gardener.
</p>

<p>
And Violet? Violet was calm and tearless, but heart-broken. She would not see
Aymer till the third day—it was the morning of the inquest, though she
did not know it. She saw him in her own room, still darkened. A thrush was
singing loud and clear in the tree below the window. The sun still shone as it
had done upon the bridal day, but the room was dark.
</p>

<p>
Miss Merton, despite her horror, had remained by her friend. She left the
apartment as Aymer entered, Violet could not speak to him. Her head drooped on
his shoulder, and convulsive sobs shook her form.
</p>

<p>
It is better to leave them together. The soled wedding-dress, the beautiful
pearl necklace tinged with the horrible hue of blood, had been carefully put
out of sight. People were searching for the wedding-ring in the chancel at the
church, but could not find it.
</p>

<p>
The inquest was held at the Shepherd’s Bush. As had been the case at
another inquest a century before, held at a place then almost as
retired—at Wolf’s Glow—so here the jury was formed of the
farmers of the district.
</p>

<p>
Bury Wick village was so small it had no inn, which was accounted for by the
fact that no through road ran by it. The village inn was half a mile from the
houses, alone by itself, on the edge of the highway. The Shepherd’s Bush
was small, merely a cottage made into a tavern, and the largest room barely
held the jury.
</p>

<p>
It is not material to us to go into every detail; the main features of that
painful inquiry will be sufficient.
</p>

<p>
The jury having been sworn, proceeded in solemn procession to The Place. They
entered noiselessly, not to disturb “Miss Vi’let,” for whom
the sympathy was heartfelt. They viewed the body of the good old man, cut down
at the very hour when the crowning desire of his heart was in the act of
realisation.
</p>

<p>
Such juries usually hurry through their task, shrinking from the view of the
dead which the law compels upon them—a miserable duty, and often quite
useless. But in this case they lingered in the room.
</p>

<p>
Saying little or nothing, they collected in groups of two or three around the
coffin, wistfully gazing upon the features of the dead. For the features were
placid, notwithstanding the terrible wound upon the top of the head. The peace
of his life clung to him even in a violent death.
</p>

<p>
There was not one man there who could remember a single word or deed by which
the dead had injured any human being. Quiet, retired, benevolent, largely
subscribing in an unostentatious manner to the village charities, ready always
with a helping hand to the poor—surely he ought to have been secure? What
motive could there be?
</p>

<p>
They returned to the Shepherd’s Bush. The Coroner asked for the evidence
of the person who had last seen the deceased alive. It was at once apparent
that numbers had seen him.
</p>

<p>
Mr Merton, who attended, self-employed, to watch the case for Violet, and from
attachment to his deceased friend—was selected as a representative of the
many. He deposed that he had last seen the deceased alive at quarter to eleven
on the marriage-day, at the moment that the bride took leave of her father, and
received his blessing. This simple statement produced a profound impression.
The deceased, who little thought that that parting would last for ever, was
then sitting as usual in his armchair, which he could wheel about as he chose,
close to the open window—almost <i>in</i> the window—and as witness
escorted the bride to her carriage, he looked back and saw the deceased had
partly turned round, so that the back of his head was towards the window. He
had then his velvet skullcap off, and witness believed that he was engaged in
silent prayer. This statement also naturally produced a profound effect. The
deceased’s head was partially bald, and the little hair he had was grey.
The day was very warm and sultry.
</p>

<p>
Mr Merton paused, and the next witness was the first person who had seen the
deceased after the fatal attack. This was the gardener. He appeared in court,
visibly shaking, bearing the marks of recent excitement upon his countenance.
He was an aged man, clad in corduroys and grey, much-worn coat—not the
suit he had worn on the wedding-day. His name was Edward Jenkins. His wife
pressed hard to be admitted to the court, but was forbidden, and remained
without, wringing her hands and sobbing. This witness was much confused, and
his answers were difficult to get—not from reluctance to speak, but from
excitement and fear. He produced an unfavourable impression upon the Coroner,
which the medical man in court observing, remarked that he had recently
attended the witness for heart disease at the request of the deceased, who took
a great interest in his old servant. Even this, however, did not altogether
succeed—there was an evident feeling against the man.
</p>

<p>
His evidence, when reduced to writing, was singularly simple, vague, and
unsatisfactory. Why had he not gone to the church to see the wedding, as it
appeared every single person had done, not even excepting the dog Dando? He had
much desired to see the marriage of his young mistress; but being the only
man-servant, it was his duty to see to the wines and to the table; and at the
time when the carriage started he was in the garden cutting fresh flowers, for
the purpose of strewing the lady’s footpath when she returned and
descended from the carriage, and also to decorate the breakfast table. How long
was it after the carriage started that anything happened? It seemed barely a
minute. He was in a remote part of the garden, hastily working,
when—almost immediately after the carriage started—he happened to
look up, and saw a stranger on the green in front of the house.
</p>

<p>
“Stay,” said the Coroner. “Describe that person.”
</p>

<p>
This he could not do. The glimpse he had caught was obtained through the boughs
and branches of several trees and shrubs. He could not say whether the stranger
was tall or short, dark or light, or what dress he wore; but he had a vague
idea that he had a dirty, grey coat on.
</p>

<p>
This was an unfortunate remark, for the witness at that moment wore such a
coat.
</p>

<p>
He could not say whether he had a hat or a cap on, nor what colour trousers he
wore. The stranger appeared to cross the green diagonally towards the house.
</p>

<p>
“What did witness do?”
</p>

<p>
For a moment he did nothing—it did not strike him as anything
extraordinary. That morning there had been scores of people about the house,
and numbers of strangers whom he did not know. They were attracted by the talk
about the wedding, and he thought no harm. He went on with his work as hastily
as he could, for he still hoped to have finished in time to make a short cut
across the fields, and see a part of the marriage ceremony.
</p>

<p>
He became so excited with the wish to see the ceremony that he left part of his
work undone. As he went he had to pass the open window of the dining-room,
where “master” was sitting. He was running, and actually passed the
window without noticing anything; but before he had got to the front door he
heard a groan. He ran back, and found his master prone on the floor of the
apartment, in a pool of blood. He had evidently fallen out of his armchair
forwards—started up and fallen. Witness, excessively frightened, lifted
him up, and placed him in the chair, and it was in so doing that his
shirt-front became saturated with the sanguinary stream, which also dyed his
hands. He had on a shirt-front and a black suit, in order to wait at table at
the wedding-breakfast. “Master” never spoke or groaned again. So
soon as he was placed in the armchair his head dropped on one side as if quite
dead, and witness then ran as fast as he could to the church, and crossed the
fields by a short cut which brought him to the chancel-door.
</p>

<p>
The stranger, who had crossed, the narrow “green” or lawn before
the house, had entirely disappeared, and he saw nothing of him in the house. In
his haste and confusion, he did not see with what the deed had been committed.
</p>

<p>
This was the substance of his evidence. Cross-examine him as they might,
neither the Coroner nor the jury, nor Mr Merton, could get any further light.
The witness was evidently much perturbed. There were those who thought his
manner that of a guilty man—or, at least, of a man who knew more than he
chose to tell. On the other hand, it might be the manner of an aged and weakly
man, greatly upset in mind and body by the frightful discovery he had made. All
the jury knew the relations between the witness and the deceased. Jenkins had
lived in the service of the Waldrons all his life, as had his father before
him, and the deceased had always exhibited the greatest interest in his
welfare. He had good wages, an easy occupation, and was well cared for in every
way. The most suspicious could conceive of no ground of quarrel or ill-will.
</p>

<p>
The Coroner directed the witness to remain in attendance, and the first person
who had seen the deceased after the alarm was given was called.
</p>

<p>
This was Phillip Lewis, a farmer’s son (one of the stewards at
World’s End Races), who being swift of foot had outstripped the others in
the run from the church to The Place.
</p>

<p>
Phillip Lewis found the deceased in his armchair, with his head drooping on one
side—just as the gardener Jenkins described; only this witness at once
caught sight of the weapon with which the fatal blow was given. It was lying on
the ground, just outside the open window, stained with blood, and was now
produced by the constable who had taken charge of it. It was a small bill-hook,
not so large as would be used in cutting hedges, but much the same shape.
</p>

<p>
The edge of a bill-hook, as every one knows, curves inward like a sickle, and
at the end the blade forms a sharp point, or spike. It is, therefore, a fearful
instrument with which to deliver a blow upon a bare head.
</p>

<p>
Phillip Lewis said that the gardener Jenkins recognised this hook as
his—the one he usually employed to lop the yew trees, and other favourite
trees of the deceased, and for general work in the shrubberies.
</p>

<p>
This piece of evidence made the jury look very sternly upon Jenkins. He was
asked if it was his, and at once admitted it. Where had he left it last? He
would not be quite sure, but he believed in the tool-house, which was close to
the gate in the garden wall, which led out into the fields. He had used it that
morning.
</p>

<p>
There was a distinct movement among the jury. They evidently began to suspect
Jenkins.
</p>

<p>
The medical man, Dr Parker, was the last witness. He had examined the wound the
deceased had received. There was first an incised wound, three inches long, on
the top of the skull, extending along the very crown of the head. This wound
was not deep, and, though serious, might not have proved mortal. At the end of
this wound there was a small space not cut at all, but an inch farther, just at
the top of the forehead, was a deep wound, which had penetrated to the brain,
and must have caused almost instantaneous death.
</p>

<p>
These peculiar wounds were precisely such as would have been made if a person
had approached the deceased from behind, and struck him on the bare head with
the bill-hook produced. He did not think that there was more than one blow. He
thought that the deceased when he received the blow must have started up
mechanically, and, losing power, fell forward on to the floor. He did not think
that the deceased had suffered much pain. There would not be time. The point or
spike-like end of the hook had stuck deep into the brain. He had examined the
hook, and found clotted gore and a few grey hairs upon the blade.
</p>

<p>
This concluded the evidence, and the court was cleared—after the Coroner
had whispered a few words to the police, several members of which force were
present.
</p>

<p>
The Coroner then summed up the evidence, and in a few brief but terribly
powerful sentences pointed out that suspicion could only attach to one man.
This man was left alone. He had every opportunity. The tale of the alleged
stranger on the lawn bore every mark of being apocryphal. It was obviously a
clumsy invention. The witness, who at first could not give any idea whatever as
to how the stranger was dressed, had, when pressed, in a manner identified
himself as the stranger, by describing him as wearing a grey coat.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, he would add that the country had been scoured by the police in
the three days that had elapsed, and they had failed to find any trace of the
supposed stranger. He then left the jury to deliberate, and going out into the
air, met Mr Merton, who was more firmly convinced than the Coroner as to the
guilt of Jenkins.
</p>

<p>
“There was no motive,” he admitted, as they talked it over, walking
slowly down the road; “but crimes were not always committed from apparent
motives. On the contrary, out of ten such crimes seven would, if investigated,
seem to be committed from very inadequate motives. How could they tell that
Waldron had not called to the gardener <i>after</i> the carriage had left, and
that then a quarrel took place?” He was determined to see that justice
was done to his dead friend.
</p>

<p>
But while the Coroner and Merton thus strolled along together a new complexion
had been put upon affairs. The wretched wife of Jenkins, who had heard the
muttered communications of the police, and saw that they kept a close look-out
upon her husband, had listened as near the door as she could get, and so heard
the summing-up of the Coroner. Distracted and out of her mind with terror, a
resource occurred to her that would never have been thought of by one less
excited. She rushed from the place like mad. “Poor old Sally has lost her
head,” said the hangers about. She ran across the fields, scrambled
through the hedges, reached The Place, tore upstairs, and threw herself upon
Violet, beseeching her for the love of God to save her poor husband.
</p>

<p>
Till that moment Violet had not the least idea that Jenkins, who had carried
her in his arms many a time when she was a child, and was more like an old
friend than a servant, was under any suspicion. She rose up at once and went
downstairs, the first time since the wedding-day. Aymer and Miss Merton tried
to stay her.
</p>

<p>
“Hush!” she said; “it is my duty.”
</p>

<p>
She was obliged to pass the fatal window; she burst into tears, but hurried on.
Aymer went with her, and assisted her along the very same route that Sally had
come—over ditches and through the gaps in the hedges. Violet reached the
Shepherd’s Bush bareheaded, panting. Involuntarily, the crowd hanging
about, one and all, boors that they were, took off their hats. She knocked at
the door where the jury sat astounded, they admitted her. Strung up to the
highest pitch she burst upon them, cowed them, overcame them.
</p>

<p>
“He is innocent!” she cried, in the full tones of her beautiful
voice. “He is innocent; let him go free! He served the dead for fifty
years; they never quarrelled; they were, like old friends, not master and man.
I am the daughter of the dead. I tell you with my whole heart and soul that
that man <i>must</i> be innocent; if you injure him, it is you who are
murderers!”
</p>

<p>
She turned and left the room; many started forward to help her, but she clung
to Aymer’s arm and he got her home as quickly as he might.
</p>

<p>
It was a noble thing. It was a truly great spectacle to see that young girl
standing there and defending the poor fellow upon whom cruel suspicion had
fallen, notwithstanding her own irreparable loss. Its effect upon the jury was
immediate and irremovable. They were silent for a time. Then one after another
found twenty loopholes of doubt where before they had been so positive. After
all, why should not the gardener’s story be true? It was a simple,
artless tale; not one that would be concocted.
</p>

<p>
One juryman, who had served on the jury at the Quarter Sessions, remembered a
great counsel in some important case laying it down as an axiom, that if a man
made up a story to defend himself it was always too complete, too full of
detail. Said the juryman: “If Jenkins had made up his story, he would
have told us what the stranger wore, what colour hat, what sort of trousers,
and every particular. There was a total absence of motive. Jenkins was a quiet,
inoffensive man, whom they had all known for years and years. Very likely,
indeed, for strangers to come to The Place on that day, the fame of which had
been talked of everywhere. Perhaps the fellow wished to steal the plate on the
breakfast table, and was surprised to find the invalid there. Hearing the
gardener coming, he would make off at once, which accounted for the fact that
not a single thing was stolen. Why should they condemn one of their own parish
on such trivial evidence?” This was the right key, the <i>local</i> one.
</p>

<p>
When the Coroner was at last called in, he was astounded at the verdict
delivered to him by the foreman—“Wilful murder against a person, or
persons, unknown.” He argued with them, but in vain; the twelve had made
up their minds and were firm as a rock. He had to submit with a bad grace!
</p>

<p>
Poor Sally had a moment of joy, and clasped her husband’s neck, but it
was of brief duration. A minute afterwards the police sergeant present tapped
Jenkins on the shoulder, and took him in custody on a charge of murder.
</p>

<p>
This is the peculiarity of the law in such cases. A suspected person has to run
the gauntlet of two bodies—first, the coroner’s jury; next, the
magistrates. Many a wretch who has escaped the one has been trapped by the
other to his doom.
</p>

<p>
The handcuffs were slipped on the gardener’s wrists and he was led away
unresistingly, followed by his weeping wife and a crowd of the villagers.
</p>

<p>
As the jury emerged from the Shepherd’s Bush, which was not till
afternoon—for they had stayed to spend their ninepenny fees—there
struck on their ears a mournful sound. It was the tolling of the village bell.
The medical man had recommended immediate interment. Only three days before
those bells had merrily rung for the daughter’s bridal; now they tolled
for the father’s burial. They hastened to the church and watched the
solemn ceremony. The low broken voice of the vicar failed at the words, as they
stood by the open vault—“He cometh up, and is cut down, like a
flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow... In the midst of life we are in
death;” and the rest of the service was nearly inaudible.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Seven.</h3>

<p>
Every one knows what a dull monotony of sorrow succeeds to a great loss.
Perhaps it was fortunate for Violet that her mind was in some small measure
withdrawn from too consuming grief by the unfortunate position of the poor old
gardener. Over the very grave of the dead, as it were, she quarrelled—the
word is hardly too strong—with Merton.
</p>

<p>
Mr Merton was bitter against Jenkins. His professional mind, always ready to
put the worst aspect upon anything, quick to suspect and slow to relinquish an
idea, was convinced of the gardener’s guilt. In his zeal for the memory
of his poor friend, he forgot that he might be injuring an innocent man. He
even went so far as to speak strongly to Violet about her visit to the jury.
Surely she should have been the last to protect the murderer. He said something
like this in the heat of his temper, and regretted it afterwards. It was cruel,
unjust, and inconsiderate. Violet simply left the room and refused to see him.
</p>

<p>
Merton left the house in a rage, and resolved to spare nothing to convict the
miserable gardener. Now this quarrel produced certain events—it set on
foot another chain of circumstances. Violet was now alone at The Place. Miss
Merton could not stay longer. Before she went she asked if she should send back
the dog Dando, which Merton had taken to Barnham. Violet, still bitter, in an
unreasoning way, against the dog, said no.
</p>

<p>
“Then,” said Miss Merton, “may I take him with me to
Torquay?”
</p>

<p>
She had taken a fancy to the dog. Violet was quite willing—anything so
that he did not return to vex her with memories of the dead. Miss Merton took
him home, sorry for her friend, and yet glad to quit that dismal house and
neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
Next day there came a note from Mr Merton, in which the writer, in a formal
way, expressed regret if he had uttered anything which had annoyed her, and
asked her to accompany Miss Merton to Torquay for change of scene. Violet
thanked him, but refused.
</p>

<p>
Aymer saw her every day. She did not give way to tears and fits of excited
sorrow, but a dull weakness seemed to have taken possession of her. All the old
spirit and joy had left her. She wandered about listlessly, stunned, in fact.
All the interest she took was in poor Jenkins’ fate. Aymer, at her wish,
went to Barnham, and engaged a lawyer to defend him. This soon reached
Merton’s ears, and annoyed him exceedingly; though, to do him justice, he
was at that very hour striving to put Violet’s affairs into order.
</p>

<p>
Those affairs were—unknown to her—in a most critical state. The
deceased, as he had told Aymer, had three thousand pounds out at interest, as
he believed, upon good security, but which he thought of calling in. This money
had been advanced to a Mr Joseph Herring, a large farmer at Belthrop, some ten
miles from World’s End.
</p>

<p>
Mr Herring was a successful man and a good man; at all events he had no worse
failing than an inordinate love of foxhunting. He had a large family, six sons
and eight daughters, but there always seemed to be plenty for them. They lived
and dressed well, rode out to the Meet, and one by one, as the sons grew older,
they were placed in farms. Foxhunting men, with the reputation of some means,
can always find favour in the eyes of landlords. If any one had been asked to
point out a fortunate family in that county, he would at once have placed his
finger upon the name of Herring.
</p>

<p>
The original home farm, where dwelt old Herring and his wife, four of the
daughters, and one son, who really managed it, was of good size, fertile, and
easily rented. The eldest son, Albert Herring, who was married and had
children, occupied a fine farm at no great distance; and the two other sons had
a smaller farm between them, and with them lived the other four sisters. Of
course it was understood that these farms had been stocked partly with borrowed
money; but that was a common thing, and there was every indication that all the
family were prospering.
</p>

<p>
It was to this Joseph Herring that Mr Waldron had advanced three thousand
pounds, taking ample security, as was believed, upon stock, and upon a small
estate which belonged to Herring’s wife. Merton recommended this Herring
as a client of his, and conducted the operation. Waldron had given Merton
notice that he wished to withdraw the money; but Merton, not thinking there was
any hurry, had not mentioned it to Joseph, when there came this awful
catastrophe at World’s End and drove the matter entirely out of his head.
But his attention was drawn back to it in an equally sudden manner. Old Joseph
Herring, the foxhunter, while out with the hounds, put his horse at a double
mound where there appeared to be a gap. This gap had been caused by cutting
down an elm tree, and he imagined that the trunk had been removed.
</p>

<p>
The morning had been cold, and although the ground was not hard there had been
what is called a “duck’s frost” in places. The horse’s
hoofs slipped upon the level butt of the tree, which had been sawn off; the
animal fell heavily, and upon his side.
</p>

<p>
In all probability, even then he would not have been much injured—for
falls in the hunting-field are as common as blackberries—had it not been
for the trunk of the elm tree. His back, in some way, came against and across
the trunk with the weight of the horse upon him, and the spine was broken. He
was carried home upon a hurdle, still living, and quite conscious.
</p>

<p>
A more terrible spectacle could not be conceived than this strong burly man
lying upon his bed, conscious, and speaking at times faintly, without a visible
wound, and yet with the certainty of death.
</p>

<p>
His sons and daughters gathered round him; all were at hand except the eldest,
Albert, and he was sent for. Joseph, who had seen too many accidents not to
know he was doomed, even if it had not been visible upon the faces of his wife
and children, betrayed the greatest uneasiness. He kept asking for
“Albert” and for “Merton.” Messenger after messenger
was despatched after both, and still they did not come.
</p>

<p>
Merton, when the messenger reached him, was in the Petty Sessional Court at
Barnham, watching the preliminary proceedings against poor Jenkins, which
happened to take place that day. He was much excited.
</p>

<p>
The lawyer whom Aymer had engaged to defend Jenkins was a professional
rival—a keen and clever man, and he had so worked up the case, and
suggested so many doubts and probabilities that the Bench of magistrates
hesitated to commit him.
</p>

<p>
It was in the thick of the fight that the messenger from the death-bed arrived.
Will it be believed, so great was the professional rivalry between these men,
and so determined was Merton to succeed in committing poor Jenkins, that he
paused, he hesitated, finally he waited till the case was finished.
</p>

<p>
“After all,” he said to himself, “very likely the accident to
Joseph is much exaggerated—people always lose their heads at such times.
At all events his neck’s not broken, and he’s alive; the messenger
doesn’t know exactly where he’s hurt. There’s no particular
hurry.”
</p>

<p>
But it so happened that there <i>was</i> a particular cause for hurry. While
Merton persuaded himself that he was looking after the cause of his murdered
friend and revenging him, that friend’s dearest one—his
Violet—was fast losing her patrimony. Even when the second messenger came
with more exact intelligence, Merton thought—“Sometimes men lie for
days with broken backs, and what does he want me for? His will is made;
I’ve got it in my office, and a very just will it is. All his affairs are
arranged, I believe. It’s all fuss and fidget.”
</p>

<p>
However, he ordered his carriage to wait at the door of the Court, and half an
hour afterwards the Bench reappeared.
</p>

<p>
The Chairman said that although there was very little evidence against the
prisoner Jenkins, although his character had been proved excellent, and
although his solicitor had most ably conducted the defence, yet the Bench felt
that the crime was one too serious for them to think of dismissing a suspected
person. The prisoner would be committed for trial at the Assizes, which
fortunately for him came on that day fortnight.
</p>

<p>
A smile of triumph lit up Merton’s face as he gathered up his papers. The
rival solicitor smiled too, and assured Aymer who was present to tell Violet
what happened, that the grand jury would be certain to throw out the bill.
There was not a tittle of evidence against the prisoner.
</p>

<p>
With this assurance Aymer mounted and rode back to Violet. At the same time
Merton, telling his coachman not to distress the horses, drove leisurely
towards the death-bed, where he had been so anxiously expected for hours.
</p>

<p>
The scene at that death-bed was extremely dreadful. The poor dying man
gradually became more and more restless and excited; nor could all the efforts
of Dr Parker, the persuasions of the clergyman, nor the tears of his wife and
children, keep him calm.
</p>

<p>
The thought of death—the idea of preparing for the hereafter never seemed
to occur to him. His one wish was to see “Albert” and
“Merton;” till feverish and his eye glittering with excitement, all
that he could ejaculate was those two names.
</p>

<p>
He remained for four hours quite conscious, and able to converse; then suddenly
there was a change, and he lost the power of answering questions, though still
faintly repeating those names. The scene was very shocking.
</p>

<p>
“Why doesn’t Albert come?” said poor Mrs Herring. “He
might have been here two hours ago. If Merton would not, Albert, my son, might
have come.”
</p>

<p>
What do you suppose Albert was doing at that moment? It is incredible, but it
is true. He was in the field superintending the placing of two new steam
ploughing engines and their tackle, watching the trial of the new engines, as
they tore up the soil with the deep plough. They had arrived that morning, just
purchased; and had it not been for their coming, he would have been in the
hunting-field with his father when the accident happened.
</p>

<p>
He could not, or would not, leave his engines. He busied about with
them—now riding himself upon the plough, now watching the drivers of the
engines, now causing experiments to be made with the scarifier. He paid little
attention to the first messenger. “Tell them I’ll be there,”
he said. Another and another messenger, still Albert remained with his plough.
</p>

<p>
“He asks for me, does he?” he said. “I’ll be there
directly.” Still he made no haste. After quitting the engines he went out
of his path to visit a flock of fat sheep, and putting up a covey of partridges
in the stubble, stayed to mark them down.
</p>

<p>
At the house he calmly refreshed himself with cheese and ale. As he mounted his
horse another messenger came, this time with a note from Dr Parker. Albert
mounted with much bustle, and made off at a gallop. Two miles on the way he
pulled up to a walk, met his shepherd, and had a talk with him about the ewes;
then the farrier on his nag, and described to him the lameness of a carthorse.
All this time his father lay dying. Strange and unaccountable indifference!
</p>

<p>
Merton reached Belthrop Farm first, and was too late. Joseph Herring was dead.
He had died without even so much as listening to the words of the
clergyman—yet he had to all appearance been a good, and even pious man
while in health. Why was he so strangely warped upon his death-bed?
</p>

<p>
“Oh! Albert—Albert, my son, my son! Why did you linger?”
cried poor Mrs Herring as he entered.
</p>

<p>
“Father?” said Albert, questioningly.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” said the son; and it sounded like a sigh of relief.
</p>

<p>
Let the grief for the dead be never so great, there quickly follows the
commonplace realities of money and affairs to be settled.
</p>

<p>
The dead man’s will was read by Merton. It was a fair and just will. Next
came the investigation into his effects, and then came the revelation. Joseph
Herring left no effects. This discovery fell upon his wife, three of the sons,
and all the daughters, like a thunderbolt. They had always believed they should
be left tolerably provided for. But when all the debts were paid there would
not be a ten-pound note.
</p>

<p>
They began to murmur, and to question, as well they might. What had become of
the three thousand pounds Herring had had of Waldron? They did not know that
their father had borrowed so much as that; they knew there was a loan from
Waldron, but never suspected the amount.
</p>

<p>
Merton, hard as it was, felt that he must draw that money in; and who was to
pay it? Why, there were no effects whatever. To pay the other debts would take
all the money that could be got, and part of the stock must be sold even then.
</p>

<p>
But this three thousand pounds. To make that good all the stock, the corn, the
implements—everything would have to be sold; including Mrs
Herring’s little estate, and the small sums that had been advanced to the
two sons who lived on one farm must be withdrawn. It was complete
ruin—ruin without reserve.
</p>

<p>
They were literally stunned, and knew not which way to turn. They could not
understand, neither could Merton, what had become of the three thousand pounds;
there was not a scrap of paper to show. Joseph had never been a good
accountant—few farmers are; but one would have thought that he would have
preserved some record of such a sum. But no—not a scrap.
</p>

<p>
Then, as said before, these children began to murmur, as well they might. Then
they began to understand, or guess dimly at the extraordinary excitement of the
dying man. It was this that weighed upon his mind, and caused him to
continually call for his eldest son and for Merton, in order that he might make
some provision.
</p>

<p>
There grew up a certain feeling against Albert. Why had he not come at
once—if he had done so, perhaps this might have been averted. A vague
distrust and suspicion of him arose. It was intensified by the knowledge that
he alone was safe. He had had a longer start and a better farm; he had the
reputation of having even saved a little money. No injury could befall him. Yet
they had not got the slightest evidence against him in any way; but a
coolness—a decided coolness arose between the brothers and sisters, and
Albert, which Albert, on his part, made no effort to remove. Ill-natured people
said he was only too glad to quarrel with them, so as to have a pretext for
refusing them assistance.
</p>

<p>
It happened, however, that one day a strange gentleman called upon Robert and
John, the two brothers, who worked one farm together. He was an agent of an
agricultural implement manufactory in a distant county, and his object was to
induce them to purchase implements of him—especially steam traction
engines. The poor brothers smiled in a melancholy way at the very idea. They
buy engines—they should soon scarcely be able to buy bread! The agent
expressed his surprise.
</p>

<p>
“But your brother seems a wealthy man,” he said. “He paid for
his engines in cash.”
</p>

<p>
“In cash!” they cried. “He told us that he paid one-fifth
only, and the rest remained in bills.”
</p>

<p>
The agent saw he had got on delicate ground; but they pressed him, and he could
not very well escape. It then came out that Albert had paid sixteen hundred
pounds in hard cash for the engines, by which, as the factory had been pressed
for money, he got them at little more than two-thirds of the value, which was
considered to be two thousand three hundred pounds.
</p>

<p>
The brothers were simply astounded. They went home and talked it over with the
fourth son, who managed the Belthrop Farm. They could not understand how Albert
came to have so much ready cash. At last the conclusion forced itself upon
them—the three thousand pounds borrowed from Waldron must have been lent
by their father to Albert. They remembered that something had been said of an
opening Albert had heard of, to add another farm to his already large tenancy.
</p>

<p>
This was the secret—poor old Joseph, a bad accountant, had given the
money to Albert, and, never thinking of dying, had postponed drawing up the
proper deeds. Without a moment’s delay they proceeded in a body to
Albert’s residence. He received them in an off-hand manner—utterly
denied that he had had the money, challenged them to find the proof, and
finally threatened if they set such a tale about the county to prosecute them
for slander. This was too much.
</p>

<p>
It is wretched to chronicle these things; but they must be written. High words
were followed by blows; there was a fight between the eldest and the next in
succession, and both being strong men, they were much knocked about. The other
brothers, maddened with their loss, actually cheered on their representative,
and stripped to take his place as soon as he should be fatigued. But at that
moment poor old Mrs Joseph Herring, who had feared this, arrived, driving up in
a pony-carriage, and sprang between the combatants. She received a severe blow,
but she separated them, and they parted with menacing gestures.
</p>

<p>
Once back at Belthrop, a kind of family council was held. Merton was sent for,
but nothing could be done. There was not a scrap of proof that Albert had had
the money. Mrs Joseph, went to him, reasoned with him, entreated him. He turned
a deaf ear to her remonstrances, and cursed her to her face. The miserable
woman returned to her despairing younger children, and never recovered the
terrible blow which the selfish, and inhuman conduct of her eldest son had
inflicted upon her. Ruin stared them in the face. Waldron’s loan was due,
and everything was already advertised for sale.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Eight.</h3>

<p>
How suddenly the leaves go in the autumn! They linger on the trees till we
almost cheat ourselves into the belief that we shall escape the inevitable
winter; that for once the inexorable march of events will be stayed, till some
morning we wake up and look forth, and lo! a wind has arisen, and the leaves
are gone.
</p>

<p>
Absorbed in the one miserable topic—the one thought of Waldron’s
terrible fate—Violet and Aymer spent several weeks almost unconsciously.
When at last they, as it were, woke up and looked forth, the actual tangible
leaves upon the trees had disappeared, and, like them, the green leaves of
their lives had been shaken down and had perished.
</p>

<p>
Even yet they had one consolation—they had themselves. The catastrophe
that had happened at the very eleventh hour, at the moment when their affection
and their hope was about to be realised, after all had only drawn them closer
together. She was more dependent upon him than ever. There was no kind Jason to
fly to now; the resources he could command were gone for ever. Had Aymer been
as selfish as he was unselfish, that very fact would not have been without its
pleasure. She could come to him only now in trouble, and she did come to him.
</p>

<p>
It may be that all that happy summer which they had spent together, strolling
about, sketching under the beech and fir; all that happy winter, with its music
and song; all the merry spring, with its rides, had not called forth such deep
and abiding love between these two as was brought into existence by these weeks
of sorrow, the first frosts of their year. They were constantly together; they
were both orphans now; they had nothing but themselves. It was natural that
they should grow all in all to each other.
</p>

<p>
There was one subject that was never alluded to between them, and that was the
interrupted marriage. It was too painful for Violet, too delicate a subject for
Aymer to mention. It was in both their minds, yet neither spoke of it. They
were, and they were not, married. In a sense—in the sense of the
publication of the banns; in the sense of the public procession to the church,
the sanction of friends, the presence of the people—in this sense they
were married. But the words “I will” had never left Violet’s
lips, however willing they were to utter the phrase; and, above all, the ring
had never been placed upon her finger. Nor could that ring be found. They were
half married.
</p>

<p>
It was a strange and exceptional case, perhaps unequalled. Morally, Violet felt
that she was his legally, Aymer feared that she was not his. He feared it,
because he knew that it would be impossible to persuade Violet to undergo the
ceremony a second time, till the memory of that dreadful day had softened and
somewhat faded. It might be months, perhaps years. The disappointment to him
was almost more than he could bear. To be so near, to have the prize within his
reach, and then to be dashed aside with the merciless hand of fate.
</p>

<p>
It would not be well that the ancient belief in destiny should again bear sway
in our time; it is contrary to the thought of the period, and yet hourly,
daily, weekly, all our lives, we seem to move, and live, and have our being
amidst circumstances that march on and on, and are utterly beyond our power to
control or guide. “Circumstances beyond my power to control” is a
household phrase—we hear it at the hearth, on the mart, in the
council-chamber. And what <i>are</i> circumstances? Why are these apparently
trivial things out of our power? Why do they perpetually evolve other
circumstances, till a chain forms itself—a net, a web—as visible,
and as tangible, as if it had been actually woven by the three sisters of
antique mythology.
</p>

<p>
The unseen, awful, inscrutable <i>necessity</i> which, heedless alike of gods
and men, marches with irresistible tread through the wonderful dramas of
Sophocles, seems to have survived the twilight of the gods, survived the age of
miracles and supernatural events. Of all that the ancients venerated and
feared, necessity alone remains a factor in modern life. What can our brightest
flashes of intelligence, our inventions, our steam engine and telegraph, effect
when confronted with those “circumstances over which we have no
control?” It is our nineteenth-century euphemism for the Fate of the
ancient world.
</p>

<p>
It is not well that we should scrutinise too closely the state of poor
Aymer’s mind. His joy and elation before that terrible day were too great
not for the fall to be felt severely. The iron of it entered into his soul. For
one moment he almost hoped against hope.
</p>

<p>
The clergyman who had officiated at the interrupted bridal came daily to see
Violet, and his true piety, his quiet parental manner, soothed and comforted
her. He whispered to Aymer that it would be well if the marriage ceremony were
completed in private, as could be done by special licence.
</p>

<p>
Aymer naturally grasped at the idea. He had still twenty pounds left of the
gift which had been sent to him anonymously. He was eager to spend it upon the
special licence, but he confessed that he dared not mention it to Violet.
</p>

<p>
The vicar undertook that task, but failed completely. Violet begged him to
spare her—to desist; she could not—not yet.
</p>

<p>
After that day she was more and more tender and affectionate to Aymer, as if to
make up to him for his loss. She said that he must take heart—they had no
need to be unhappy. In a little while, but not yet—not yet, while that
fearful vision was still floating before her eyes. But Aymer must be happy.
They had sufficient. <i>He</i> had left them all he had. That was another
reason why they should wait, in affection for his memory. They could see each
other daily—their future would be together. And Aymer, miserable as he
was, was forced to be content.
</p>

<p>
Merton had not been to The Place. Not one word had he said about the difficulty
in Herring’s affairs, and the loss of the three thousand pounds. Violet
was utterly ignorant that her fortune was gone. She spoke very bitterly of
Merton. “If he had loved poor papa,” she said, “he would
never have persecuted his faithful servant,” for nothing could shake her
belief in Jenkins’ innocence, and she did all she could to comfort the
poor gardener’s desolate wife.
</p>

<p>
Merton, on his part, did not care to approach her after the share he had had in
the commitment of Jenkins, and because he hesitated, he dreaded to face her,
and to tell her that her fortune, entrusted to his hands, was gone. He blamed
himself greatly, and yet he would not own it. He ought to have hastened to
Herring’s death-bed. Had that dying man but left one written word, to say
that Albert had had the money, all would have been well.
</p>

<p>
In the fierce attempt to revenge his old friend, he had irreparably injured
that friend’s daughter, and he dreaded the inevitable disclosure. He put
it off till the last, hoping against hope, and doing all that his
lawyer’s ingenuity could suggest to recover some part of the amount. In
endeavouring to succeed in this, he pressed hard—very hard—upon the
Herring family. He pushed them sorely, and spared not. He was bitterly
exasperated against them. Unjustly, he openly accused them of a plot to rob his
client and dishonour him.
</p>

<p>
He abused the dead man as one who had repented too late upon his death-bed. He
would take everything—down to the smallest article. Neither the
persuasions of the sons, the tears of the daughters, nor the silent despair of
the widow could move him. Of all this Violet knew nothing.
</p>

<p>
It happened that one evening not long after the lamp had been lit at The Place,
that there was heard a slight tapping or knocking at the front door. Now, this
door was close to the window where the terrible deed had been committed. By
this door the bride had stepped forth in all her gay attire; by this door the
corpse of her father had been carried forth. Villagers, and all isolated
people, are superstitious; the beliefs of those days, when all people were more
isolated than they are now, linger amongst them. By common consent, this door
was avoided by day and night. A dread destiny seemed to hang over those who
passed beneath its portal. It had been kept locked since the funeral—no
one had used it.
</p>

<p>
Violet and Aymer, sitting in the breakfast-parlour—which was the most
comfortable room in the house—were reading, and looked up mutually at the
sound of those unwonted knocks. They listened. There was a pause; and then the
taps were repeated. They were so gentle, so muffled, that they doubted the
evidence of their ears—and yet surely it was a knocking.
</p>

<p>
The servants in the kitchen heard the taps, and they cowered over the fire and
looked fearfully at each other.
</p>

<p>
One thing was certain—no person who knew The Place, no one from the
village, would come to that door. If it was any mortal man or woman, it must be
a stranger; and the last time a stranger had crossed the “green,”
all knew what had happened. If it was not a stranger, then it must be the
spirit of poor “master.” They were determined not to hear.
</p>

<p>
The taps were repeated. Violet and Aymer looked at each other.
</p>

<p>
Something very like a moan penetrated into the apartment. Aymer immediately
rose and went to the front door. He asked if any one was without; there was no
answer. He opened the door; the bitter wind, bearing with it flakes of snow,
drove into his face. For a moment, in the darkness, he could distinguish
nothing; the next, brave as he was, he recoiled; for there lay what looked like
a body at his feet. Overcoming his dread he stooped and touched—a
woman’s dress. He lifted her up—the form was heavy and inanimate in
his hands.
</p>

<p>
“Violet, dear!” he said, “it is a woman—she has
fainted; may I bring her in?”
</p>

<p>
Violet’s sympathies were at once on the alert. The woman was carried in
and laid upon the rug before the fire, the servant came crowding in to render
assistance brandy was brought, and the stranger opened her eyes and moaned
faintly. Then they saw that, although stained with travel and damp from
exposure to the drifting snow her dress was that of a lady.
</p>

<p>
Under the influence of the warm fire and the brandy she soon recovered
sufficiently to sit up. She was not handsome nor young her best features were a
broad, intellectual looking forehead, and fine dark eyes. So soon as ever she
was strong enough to speak she turned to Violet, and begged to be alone with
her for a little while.
</p>

<p>
Aymer, with all a lover’s suspicions, demurred, but Violet insisted, and
he had to be content with remaining within easy call.
</p>

<p>
He had no sooner left the room than the lady, for such she appeared to be, fell
upon her knees at Violet’s feet, and begged her for the sake of her
father’s memory to show mercy.
</p>

<p>
“Oh! spare us,” cried the unhappy creature, bursting into tears,
and wringing her hands, “spare us—we are penniless. Indeed we did
not do it purposely. We never knew—I am Esther Herring!”
</p>

<p>
It was long before Violet could gather her meaning from these incoherent
sentences. At last, under her kind words and gentle questions, Esther became
calmer and explained the miserable state of affairs. Violet sighed deeply. In
one moment her hopes were dashed to the ground: her money was gone; how could
she and Aymer—
</p>

<p>
But she bore up bravely, and listened patiently to Esther’s story. How
the widow’s heart was breaking, how the sons were despairing, and the
daughters looking forward to begging their bread. How the sale
approached—only five days more; and that thinking, and thinking day and
night over the misery of it, Esther had at last fled to Violet for
mercy—to Violet, who was ignorant of the whole matter. Fled on
foot—for all their horses were seized—on that wild winter
afternoon, facing the bitter wind, the snow, and the steep hills for ten long
miles to World’s End. Fled to fling herself at Violet’s feet, and
beg for mercy upon the widow and the fatherless children. The fatigue and her
excitement had proved too much, and she had fainted at the very door. Esther
dwelt much upon Mr Merton’s cruelty, for his insults had out her to the
quick.
</p>

<p>
Violet became very pale. She went to the door and called softly,
“Aymer.” He came, and Esther attempted to dry her tears. Violet
told him all, and took his hand.
</p>

<p>
“This cannot be,” she said; “this surely must not be. I will
do—we will do—as of a surety my father would have done. The
innocent shall not suffer for the guilty. We, Aymer and I, will give up our
claim. Tell them at your home to be comforted and to fear not.”
</p>

<p>
Esther saw that her mission was accomplished, and the reaction set in. She
became ill and feverish. Violet had her taken upstairs and waited upon her.
Aymer was left alone. He walked to the window, opened the shutters, and looked
forth. The scud flew over the sky, and the wan moon was now hidden, and now
shone forth with a pale feeble light. The heart within him was very bitter. He
did not repent the renunciation which he had confirmed; he felt that it was
right and just. But it was a terrible blow. It cut away the very ground from
beneath his feet.
</p>

<p>
The poor fellow—he was poor Aymer again now—looked forward to the
future. What could he do? The talents he possessed were useless, or nearly
useless, in a pecuniary sense. Unable to earn sufficient to support himself,
how could he marry Violet? The thought was maddening. To continue in the old,
old life at Wick Farm without a prospect was impossible. To wander a beggar
from door to door would be preferable. When he found that Violet could not
leave Esther, he walked home to Wick Farm; over the wild and open Downs, and
his heart went up in a great and bitter cry.
</p>

<p>
The blow that had struck down poor Waldron had struck him down also. It is ever
thus with evil. The circle widens, and no man knows where it will end. Yet he
did not falter.
</p>

<p>
Next day Violet wrote a curt letter to Mr Merton, requesting him to forbear
proceedings, and upbraiding him for his cruelty. She desired that he would
relinquish the charge of her affairs.
</p>

<p>
Merton, had he so chosen, might have made a difficulty about this—under
the will of Waldron—but he did not. He was, to say truth, glad of a
pretext to wash his hands of a matter in which he had figured so ill.
</p>

<p>
Violet sent for the same solicitor who had defended Jenkins, Mr Broughton, and
desired him to see that proceedings were stayed. The Herrings were saved.
Esther was sent home in the pony-carriage with the good tidings. Other debts,
unsuspected before, ate up most of the effects of Joseph Herring. The
widow’s little property had to be sold to meet them. With the trifle that
was left they removed to the farm where the two brothers worked together, and
by dint of careful management escaped starvation. Neither were they unhappy,
for misfortune and a common injury bound them closer together—all but the
widow, who never overcame the duplicity of her eldest son.
</p>

<p>
Their conduct towards Violet appears extremely selfish, but it must be
remembered that Waldron had borne the reputation of being a rich man. They
never dreamt that they had taken Violet’s all. But so it was. The dear,
dear ponies had to be sold, the servants dismissed; Violet could not keep the
house on, and in that isolated position it was difficult to let it, even at a
nominal rent.
</p>

<p>
Her friends in London made no sign. She had been a favoured guest while Waldron
lived and was reputed wealthy. Now they had lost sight of her.
</p>

<p>
To Aymer all this was as gall and wormwood. It was a comment upon his own
weakness, and impotency to aid the only one he loved. He wrote, he sketched;
but now with the strange inconsistency of fortune these works were returned, as
“not up to the standard required.” Perhaps his misfortunes affected
his skilfulness. He knew not which way to turn. At home—if Wick Farm
could be called home—the old state of things began to gradually return.
The old covert sneers and hints at his uselessness crept again into the daily
conversation. Martin, like Hercules—
</p>

<p class="poem">
Rude, unrefined in speech.<br />
Judging all wisdom by its last results,
</p>

<p>
looked upon him as a failure, and treated him accordingly. To do the young men
justice, those who had formerly taunted him now never lost an opportunity of
expressing their regret. Poor Aymer felt this worse than their sneers and
gibes. He had the fault of pride, and yet he depreciated himself habitually. He
was punished severely for his brief period of elation. What hurt him most was
his helplessness to aid Violet. And Violet, noble girl! was calm, resigned,
fearless in her trust—strong in her love of Aymer.
</p>

<p>
But the inevitable approached—“the circumstances over which we have
no control.” The day was coming when she must go, and go—whither?
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Nine.</h3>

<p>
Down to one firm faith in this day of scepticism and cynicism. It may be a
despicable weakness—that cannot be helped—but nothing will ever
overthrow it. My faith is firm in the good which is possible in woman.
</p>

<p>
There is much vice, much evil, much folly; but, after all, these faults are
chiefly caused by weakness, therefore they are more or less excusable. It is
difficult for women to do good—so many and so complex are the restraints
which surround them as in a net—yet they do it. Were I in sorrow, in
trouble, or in fear, to them I should go, as hundreds—ay, countless
numbers—have previously gone, certain of assistance if assistance were
possible, and of compassion and sympathy, even if my crimes were too evil to
speak of.
</p>

<p>
There was heard one afternoon at The Place the roll of carriage-wheels—a
sound that had not been heard since the fatal bridal day. It was a damp, cold
day, and Violet had been unable to go out. A fog hung over the fields, creeping
slowly along the fallows, clinging in shapeless clouds upon the hill tops.
There was no rain, but the bare hedges were dripping large drops of water
condensed from the mist, and the dead leaves upon the ground were soddened with
damp. On such days as these, when she could not walk out and dispel her gloom
by exercise, Violet naturally felt the loss of poor Jason the more.
</p>

<p>
Aymer could not be always with her. Although their intercourse was little, if
at all, fettered by the etiquette which would have barred it in more civilised
neighbourhoods, yet he could not be always at The Place, and of late he had
been working hard at sketches and literary matters, which occupied time and
kept him from her side.
</p>

<p>
She was very lonely, longing for the evening, when he would be certain to come.
The roll of these carriage-wheels was therefore an event. Looking from the
window upstairs—that very window whence, in all the splendour of her
beauty and her wedding-dress, she had timidly glanced forth to watch the
approach of the greys—she saw a stylish brougham rapidly nearing the
house, and as it came nearer recognised the horses, and knew it was Lady
Lechester’s.
</p>

<p>
Agnes, not waiting for the footman to announce her visit, sprang out, and
walked at once to the front door. Once more there came a tapping at that dread
portal.
</p>

<p>
Conquering her fluttering heart, Violet, in a maze of bewilderment, opened it
herself. Agnes held out her hand, and kissed her twice upon the cheek and
forehead.
</p>

<p>
“Forgive me!” she said. “Forgive me for coming so soon
after—. But I wanted to see you; I had much to say to you.”
</p>

<p>
Violet began to thank her in a confused way for the pearl necklace. Agnes
stopped her; it was not that—it was about Violet herself that she had
come to talk. Even in her surprise and confusion, Violet could not help
thinking that Agnes was very beautiful. It was a species of beauty that was
precisely the opposite of Violet’s. Both gained by the contrast of the
other’s style.
</p>

<p>
Agnes Lechester was at least thirty—she might have been a year or two
older—and there hovered over her countenance an indefinable air of
melancholy, as if the memory of a past sorrow was for ever before her mind.
There was not a wrinkle, not a groove upon her pale brow, but the impress of
pain was none the less unmistakable upon her features. Her hair was very dark,
as near as possible to the raven’s hue, so often spoken of, so rarely
seen. Her eyes were large and grey, deep-set under delicate eyebrows,
well-marked, and slightly arching. Her forehead high and intellectual. The
features, the nose and mouth, were small and well-made, the ears especially
delicate. High blood and long descent spoke out clearly in her every aspect,
down even to the quiet subdued manner—the exquisite tact, and
consideration for others, which distinguished her in conversation and in daily
life.
</p>

<p>
She was about the same height as Violet, but appeared taller, being more
slightly made. She wore a simple black-silk, extremely plain, and one
mourning-ring—no other jewellery.
</p>

<p>
Violet, whose position was not a little embarrassing, found herself in a few
moments entirely at her ease, and conversing as with an old friend. Agnes did
not in a direct manner recall the terrible past, but she had a way of asking
what may be called sympathising questions, which quickly drew forth
Violet’s confidence.
</p>

<p>
For the first time she found a sister to whom she could express her feelings
unrestrainedly; and even that brief hour of companionship did her much good.
Not till all trace of distant formality had been removed, not till there had
been a certain degree of familiarity established between them, did Agnes allude
to the real object of her visit. She had come to ask Violet as a
favour—so she put it—to spend a little time with her. The Towers
were so very, very lonely—she said this in a tone that was evidently
sincere—she had so few visitors, practically none, and she should be so
glad if Violet would come. Violet saw in an instant that it was really out of
kindness to her that the invitation was given; she wished to accept it, and yet
hesitated. Agnes pressed her. Then she remembered Aymer—what would he
say? If she went, he would be alone—he would not see her, and she would
not see him. Thinking of him, a slight blush rose to her cheek. Perhaps Agnes
guessed what was passing in her mind, for she said—
</p>

<p>
“Mr Malet will, of course, come and see us—often. You must ask his
permission, you know. I will come again to-morrow and fetch you in the
brougham.”
</p>

<p>
So it was practically settled, and Agnes, after a warm farewell, departed.
Violet waited for Aymer, almost fearing he would upbraid her; but then the
separation would only be for a little time. A little time!
</p>

<p>
When Agnes Lechester came to ask her to The Towers, she came with a full
knowledge of Violet’s position—of her monetary loss, and of the
noble self-sacrifice she had made.
</p>

<p>
It chanced—“circumstances over which we have no control”
again—that Mr Broughton, to whom Violet had transferred her affairs, had
succeeded to the business of an uncle, an elder Mr Broughton, who was almost
the hereditary solicitor of the Lechester family. The position was one of great
emolument, and gave some social precedence; hence, perhaps, part of the
jealousy exhibited towards him by Mr Merton—an older man, and not so
fortunate. From him Agnes learnt the whole of the details. The frightful
catastrophe—the mystery of the murder of poor Waldron—had greatly
impressed her, and the sad circumstances of the interrupted bridal trebled the
interest she had taken in Violet and Aymer. She had instructed Broughton to
inform her of everything, and especially of how matters stood with Violet now
her father was no more. As he had now the charge of Violet’s affairs, it
was easy for him to do this; and being a comparatively young man, and with a
heart not yet quite dead to feeling, he was himself much interested in the
woman who could so willingly give up the last fragment of her fortune.
</p>

<p>
Agnes Lechester was deeply impressed by Violet’s generosity and
abrogation of self—she felt the warmest sympathy and desire to assist
her—she really was anxious to make her acquaintance, and the result was
her visit to The Place. Ostensibly the invitation was for a little time only;
but Agnes knew that the house, which alone was left to Violet, could not
support her, and intended to prolong the invitation indefinitely. She really
was lonely, and really did look forward to a companion in whom she could trust.
</p>

<p>
Aymer was overjoyed when he heard what had happened, and insisted upon Violet
accepting the invitation. Violet’s isolation, and the daily increasing
awkwardness of her position, troubled him greatly. He knew not what to do for
her. Here was a resource—a haven of safety for a while at least. Never
mind about himself—doubtless he could see her sometimes; so long as she
was safe and comfortable he should be happy, much happier even than in their
present unrestricted intercourse—though this was said with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
He lingered long with her that evening, longer than he had ever done before; it
was the last, perhaps, they should ever spend together in that house, which was
still very dear to them, notwithstanding the tragedy it had witnessed. The time
came at last when they must separate. It was the saddest walk that night that
he had ever had across the Downs. They were enveloped in a thick
mist—only instinct and long use kept him in the path—an
impenetrable gloom hung over him. Even the fir trees were silent; there was no
breeze to stir them, to produce that low sighing sound that seems to mean so
much to those who will pause and listen.
</p>

<p>
The morrow was brighter; there was a little sunshine, clouded and feeble, but
still there was a little. It would be difficult to explain the process by which
it came about. There are means of communication between persons without direct
words. Thus it happened that almost by a species of volition, Agnes Lechester,
Violet, and Aymer, before the hour to depart arrived, walked slowly and
mournfully to the old, old church, across the meadows by the well-worn path,
which the morning’s frost had left hard and dry. Since that terrible day
Violet had never been—she could not. But now, somehow, with this
newly-found companion, strengthened by two loving hearts, one on either side,
it seemed to her as if a holy peace might perhaps descend upon her if she could
visit her father’s tomb.
</p>

<p>
With her face hidden by a thick veil, the tears standing in her eyes, the poor
girl walked between them. Few words passed—silence was more natural and
fitting than speech. They met two or three persons, all of whom knew Violet and
Aymer; but these paid the homage to sorrow which the rudest tender, and went by
silently, raising their hats. No one interrupted them; no one stared with
vulgar curiosity. These three were alone—alone with the memory of the
dead. And strangely enough, all three were orphans. It was Agnes Lechester who
reminded them of that fact as they stood before the tomb; it was, she said in a
low voice, another bond of union between them.
</p>

<p>
The inscription had not yet been put up; the slab was plain. Their visit was
very short; it was more than Violet could bear. The tomb was just without the
church. Agnes motioned to Aymer to leave them; he walked away a few paces.
Together the two women entered the church; they were alone in the sacred
edifice. With slow steps poor Violet, leaning on Agnes’s arm and sobbing
bitterly, walked up that very aisle, over that very figure of the ancient
knight in brass, past the antique font—the very aisle where she had gone
in all her wedding splendour amid the admiration of the gathered crowd. And now
she came again—came with a stranger—in silence and sorrow, to kneel
on the steps that led up to the chancel to pray as best her throbbing heart
would permit. Was that prayer more for the living, or the dead?
</p>

<p>
Violet had been reared a Protestant in the Articles of the Church of England,
yet I question whether in that supreme moment her soul was not fuller of prayer
for him who had gone before, than for herself and those who still lingered on
earth. Those among us who can remember bitter hours of agony, say truly for
whom have <i>they</i> prayed? Let us not penetrate further into the sanctuary
of sorrow.
</p>

<p>
The carriage rolled away, and Aymer was alone. He watched it go down into the
valley out of sight. He turned and ascended the Downs, not daring to look back
upon the old, old house. At the summit he could command an extended view. Far
away the white road ran up over a hill, and he could see a black dot crawling
slowly up it. He knew it was the carriage; he watched it reach the top and
disappear over the brow—then she was gone.
</p>

<p>
For the first time since love had arisen in his heart he was separated from
her. It was true that it was not total separation. They were bound together by
ties which nothing could sever, and yet—the happy past was gone, to
return no more. He was at liberty to see her at The Towers; Agnes Lechester had
done her best to impress upon him that he could come whenever he chose, and
would be always welcome. But Aymer had the vaguest ideas of what life with the
upper ranks was like; he had a vague shrinking from entering this house; he
felt that he should be restrained and at a loss. There could never be that free
intercourse between him and Violet that had existed. He felt in his heart that
she would never more return to The Place. The house was to be closed that
evening; would it ever be opened again?
</p>

<p>
He crushed back his despair as best he could, and went home to his cold, lonely
room at the Wick Farm. Martin grudged him a fire even. Aymer crushed back his
heart, and tried to work. It was very difficult. When the hand and the body are
numbed with physical cold, when the heart is chilled with grief, it is hard
indeed to call the fancy into play and to amuse others. Was it not Goldsmith
who wrote the “Vicar of Wakefield” to pay the expenses of his
parent’s funeral?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps no greater proof of his wonderful genius could be given than is
presented by that oft-repeated and simple anecdote. Only a transcendant genius
could have forced itself out under such miserable circumstances. Aymer
certainly had talent, perhaps even genius, but he had not yet found his
opportunity—he was not quite certain wherein his ability really lay. All
his efforts were tentative. They failed one and all—failed just at the
moment when what he most wanted was a little encouragement. He did not spare
himself; he worked the whole day, saving only an hour put aside to walk upon
the Downs for health’s sake.
</p>

<p>
He had still fifteen pounds remaining of the munificent, and anonymous present
he had received. This he husbanded with the utmost care; it was his capital,
his all. With it he formed schemes of reaching London, and finding employment.
He only waited till a work upon which he was now engaged was finished before he
started. Now Violet was gone, there was no inducement to remain at
World’s End; far better to go out and face hard facts, and conquer them.
</p>

<p>
But as the days went by, and the work was half finished, a deadly despair
seemed to seize him. Of what use was it? Every slow post that reached that
almost forgotten spot returned to him work rejected and despised. His sketches,
he was told, “wanted spirit;” his literary labours “wanted
finish, and bore marks of haste.”
</p>

<p>
If these were useless, of what good was it to complete this book he was
writing? It would only end in another disappointment. He ceased to open his
letters; he flung them on one side. For a day or two he did nothing—he
wandered about on the open Downs, seeking consolation from Nature, and finding
none. At last, accusing himself of a lack of energy and fortitude, he set to
work again. So it was not till two days after date that he read the following
letter, which had been cast upon one side with the rest:—
</p>

<p class="letter">
“2, Market Cross, Barnham.<br />
    “Dear Sir,—I am requested by Mr Broughton to ask you to call
upon him at your earliest convenience. He has some employment to offer
you.<br />
    “With esteem, etc, etc.”
</p>

<p>
He went. Broughton received him kindly, and explained that he wanted a clerk,
not so much for technical work as for correspondence, and to give general
assistance. Aymer being a novice and completely ignorant of such duties, could
not of course expect much salary. However, he would have thirty-five shillings
per week. This offer was made partly through Lady Lechester’s influence,
partly out of the interest he himself took in Aymer. But a true lawyer, he
could not help doing even good as cheaply as possible. Aymer thanked him, and
accepted the post.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Ten.</h3>

<p>
Aymer would in times gone by have regarded the employment he had now obtained
as a great step in advance, and have rejoiced accordingly. But he had been too
near the prize for it to give him even so much as hope for the future. He
<i>wished</i> to be grateful for what he had got; he tried to look upon it as a
wonderful thing, but it was impossible. The contrast between the actual, and
what had been within his very grasp was too intense.
</p>

<p>
It was an easy place. Beyond a little correspondence to write for Mr Broughton,
and sometimes a little copying, he had practically nothing to do. His hours
were short for the business—only from ten till four; he had plenty of
time at his own disposal.
</p>

<p>
The fact was that his salary came, not directly, but indirectly from Lady
Lechester, and he was favoured accordingly. If he had known this he would have
been still more dissatisfied.
</p>

<p>
The office in which he was placed was a kind of library or retiring apartment,
opening by double doors into Mr Broughton’s private room; and he was
often called upon to bear witness to certain transactions of a strictly private
nature, and in which the solicitor told him he relied upon his honour as a
gentleman, to preserve secrecy.
</p>

<p>
Broughton really meant him well, and did his best now and then to start him on
in the acquisition of a knowledge of the law. Books were put into his hands,
and he was told what parts of them to study, and had to prepare extracts from
them occasionally. Aymer did his best, conscientiously, but he hated
it—he hated it most thoroughly. It was not altogether that the reading in
these books was dry and uninteresting to the last degree. Flat, tame,
spiritless, meaningless,—a mere collection of decisions, interpretations,
precedents—such they appeared at first. Aymer had talent and insight
sufficient to speedily observe that this forbidding aspect was not the true
one.
</p>

<p>
All these precedents, rules, decisions—these ten thousand subtle
distinctions—were much like the laws or rules of a game at chess. They
decided in what way a pawn should be moved or a bishop replaced. The science of
law seemed to him like a momentous game at chess, only the pieces were living
human creatures.
</p>

<p>
These subtle distinctions and technical divisions, formalities though they
appeared, had a meaning, and a deep one. Following his employer, Mr Broughton,
into the petty law courts at Barnham, he saw how the right and the wrong, the
sorrow or the joy of human beings depended almost upon the quibble of a word,
the incident of a slip of the pen. It was a game—a game requiring long
study, an iron memory, quick observation, and quicker decision; and he hated
it—hated it because the right appeared to be of no consequence. Truth,
and what he had always thought was meant by justice, were left entirely out of
sight.
</p>

<p>
It was not the man who had the right upon his side who won. If that was the
case, what use would there be for lawyers? Too often it was the man who had the
law upon his side, and the law only. He actually heard magistrates, and even
judges, expressing their regret that the law compelled them to give decisions
contrary to the true justice of the cause before them.
</p>

<p>
By degrees he became aware of the extraordinary fact, that with all the
cumbrous system of law phrases—a system that requires a special
dictionary—there was not even a word to express what he understood as
justice; not even a word to express it!
</p>

<p>
Justice meant a decision according to the law, and not according to the right
or wrong of the particular case proceeding; equity meant a decision based upon
a complex, antiquated, unreasonable jumble of obsolete customs. The sense of
the word “equity”—as it is used in the sublime prophecy,
“With equity shall he judge the world”—was entirely lost.
</p>

<p>
In the brief time that he had sat beside Mr Broughton in these Courts, Aymer
conceived an intense loathing for the whole system. After all, what was the
law, upon which so much was based, which over-rode equity, justice, truth, and
even conscience? What was this great fetish to which every one bowed the
knee—from the distinguished and learned judge downwards, the judge who,
in point of fact, admitted and regretted that he decided against his
conscience? It was principally precedent. Because a man had once been hung for
a murder committed in a certain manner, men must always be hung for murder.
Because a judge had once given a verdict which, under the circumstances, was as
<i>near the right</i> as he dared to go (and our judges do this), then every
one who came after must be dealt with by this immovable standard.
</p>

<p>
The very passage of time itself—the changes introduced into society,
custom, and modes of thought in the course of the years—was in itself a
strong and all-sufficient argument against this fetish precedent.
</p>

<p>
That was not all. Aymer in his position—to a certain extent
confidential—had a glimpse behind the scenes. Quick of observation and
comprehension, he saw that even this game of argument, and precedent, and
quibble was not conducted honestly. He had heard and read so much of the
freedom, the liberty of England, the safety of the subject, the equal justice
meted out to all, that he was literally confounded when the bare facts stared
him in the face.
</p>

<p>
There was jobbery, corruption under the whole of it; there was class prejudice
operating in the minds of those on the judgment-seat; there were a
thousand-and-one small, invisible strings, which palled this way and that
behind the scenes. It was, after all, a species of Punch and Judy show, moved
by wires, and learnt by rote by the exhibitor.
</p>

<p>
It sickened and wearied him. Sitting on those hard benches, he longed for
liberty—longed to escape from the depressing influence of the atmosphere
of chicanery in which he was plunged. The very sight of those hideous faces
which are sure to congregate in the criminal justice-room, seemed to weaken the
fresh young spirit within him.
</p>

<p>
Yet, as said before, Mr Broughton used him kindly. He found Aymer lodgings
cheap and fairly comfortable. Aymer had often desired to escape from his
solitary room at Wick Farm; but even that cold, lonely apartment was better
than this. These four walls had no association—they were walls
only—partly concealed with a few common prints. One of these, over the
mantelpiece, looked down upon him as he sat by his fire in the evening. He saw
it night after night, till at last that engraving seemed to almost live, and he
watched to see when the labour of the prisoner should be completed. For it was
the picture of the prisoner sitting in his cell upon a stone bench, painfully
chiselling out upon the stone wall—just where a single beam of sunlight
fell—the figure of Christ upon the Cross, with the rude tool of a common
iron nail.
</p>

<p>
He grew to understand the feelings and the thought, to sympathise in the work
of the prisoner in his dungeon. The solitary ray of sunshine that fell upon his
life was the love of Violet. He was himself confined, imprisoned by the iron
bars and the strong walls of poverty, and the tools he had at hand for his
labour of love were scanty and rude. How could he in that contracted sphere,
without travel, without change of scene and conversation with other men, ever
hope to find materials for works with which to please the world, and obtain for
himself fame and position? He understood now the deep meaning of the words put
in Ulysses’ mouth—“I am a part of all that I have met.”
They applied with tenfold force to the artistic, and to the literary career. It
was only by extended experience, by contact with the wide, wide world, that he
could hope to comprehend what it wanted. Yet it sometimes happened that even
the prisoner in his cell, by sheer self-concentration, and with the aid of the
rude tools and material within his reach, produced a work which could not be
surpassed. The poor prisoner of the picture reminded him constantly of this. He
tried. He thought and thought, till at last, in the quiet and solitude of his
lonely room, an idea did occur to him—not a very great or remarkable idea
either, but still one which, he felt, if properly carried out, might produce
substantial results.
</p>

<p>
Evening after evening, upon leaving the office, he laboured at his new
conception, illustrating his book with his own pencil, spending hour after hour
upon it far into the night. So absorbed was he upon it, that he almost
neglected Violet’s letters—almost, he could not quite—but his
notes were so short and so unlike his usual style, that she, with her knowledge
of his character, saw at once what he was doing, and kept begging him not to
overwork himself.
</p>

<p>
“Circumstances over which we have no control.” There are other
circumstances still more powerful—i.e., those circumstances which we
never even think of controlling, which happen so quietly and whose true
significance is so little apparent at the time, that we pass them by without a
thought.
</p>

<p>
It happened that Mr Broughton was engaged in a cause which necessitated
extracts to be made from a file of old newspapers. Being overworked himself,
and his staff also in full employment, he asked Aymer to do this, and to do it
especially well and carefully. Aymer began the work, and at first found it dry
enough, but as he got deeper into it, the strange contrast presented by this
contemporary chronicle with the present day gradually forced itself upon him,
and he ceased to cast aside the papers so soon as the particular extract
required was made.
</p>

<p>
Presently the idea occurred to him of writing an article for the London papers,
founded upon the curiosities of these old sheets of news. With this view, after
he had finished the work he was set to do, he got into the habit of carrying
two or three of the papers home, and re-reading and studying them, and making
notes by his own fireside. The file was really interesting. It began in the
year 1710. The <i>Barnham Chronicle</i> was one of those extremely old papers
published in county towns, which live on from year to year without an effort,
because they meet with no opposition. The circle of its readers, in all
probability, at that date—more than a century and a half after its
establishment—was scarcely larger than in the first year of publication.
It had been taken and read by whole generations. The son found it taken by his
father, and when he succeeded to the farm, to the mill, or to the shop,
continued the old subscription.
</p>

<p>
Looked at in the light of the present day, when intelligence is flashed from
end to end of the kingdom in a few hours, the <i>Barnham Chronicle</i> was all
but ridiculous. Its news was a week old or more, stale and unprofitable. It did
not even advance so far as to have a London letter; but perhaps that was no
great loss to its readers.
</p>

<p>
Yet the <i>Barnham Chronicle</i> was a “property” in more than one
sense; it paid, as well it might, at fourpence per copy, and with the monopoly
of auctioneer’s and lawyer’s advertisements in that district. And
it could boast of a more than patriarchal age.
</p>

<p>
Reading slowly, paragraph by paragraph, through this enormous file, his
note-book at his side, Aymer came upon one advertisement, simply worded, and
with no meretricious advantage given to it by large type or other
printer’s resource, yet which he read with a special interest. It
contained the name of Waldron, of The Place, Bury Wick; and that name was
sufficient to attract him. It ran thus:—
</p>

<p class="letter">
“Notice of Change of Name.—I, Arthur Sibbold, tea-dealer, of the
City of London, in the county of Middlesex, do hereby give notice, that it is
my intention to apply for permission to add to my present baptismal names the
name of Waldron, upon the occasion of my approaching marriage with Miss Annica
Waldron, of The Place, Bury Wick, co. B—, etc, etc. And that I shall be
henceforward known, called, and designated by the name of Arthur Sibbold
Waldron in all deeds, writings, etc, etc.”
</p>

<p>
To us who are acquainted with the history of the city of Stirmingham, this
entry has a wide significance; to Aymer it had none beyond the mere fact of the
mention of Waldron. He copied it into his note-book with a mental resolve to
show it to Violet, and thought no more of it. An event that happened about this
time made him forget all about what appeared to him a trivial matter. This was
the trial of Jenkins, the gardener, for the murder of Jason Waldron. Mr
Broughton, who was engaged for the defence, to instruct counsel, naturally made
much use of Aymer’s local knowledge and perfect acquaintance with the
details of that terrible day, and was thereby furnished with fresh and
overwhelming arguments.
</p>

<p>
Aymer worked with a will, for he knew that Violet was much concerned and
extremely anxious as to the result, and he watched the proceedings on the
fateful day with intense interest. It is needless to recapitulate the details
of the case, which have been already given. The result was an acquittal. The
Judge summed up in favour of the prisoner, observing that it was monstrous if a
man must be condemned to the last penalty of the law, because it so chanced
that a tool belonging to him had been snatched up as the readiest instrument
for a murderous attack. To his experience the murder did not appear at all in
the light of an ordinary crime. In the first place, there was an apparent
absence of motive. So far as was known, Waldron had no enemies and no quarrel
with any man. Evidently it was not committed with the intention of theft, as
not a single article had been missed. It appeared to him like the unaccountable
impulse of an unreasoning being; in plain words, like the act of <i>a lunatic
with homicidal tendencies</i>. The jury unanimously acquitted the prisoner, and
Aymer hastened to send the news to Violet. He could not post with it himself,
as Mr Broughton had other cases to attend to.
</p>

<p>
Poor Jenkins was free—and lost. The shock had stunned him, and he was too
old and too much weakened by disease to ever recover from it. He could not face
his native village, the place where his family, though humble, had for
generations borne a good character. He had an almost childish dread of meeting
any one from Bury Wick or World’s End, and even avoided Aymer, who sought
him in the crowd.
</p>

<p>
How truly was it said that “service is no inheritance!” After two
generations of faithful service, these poor people were practically exiled from
home and friends, and this without fault of their own. Violet would have gladly
done what she could for the aged couple. They might have, at all events, lived
at The Place and taken care of the old house, but she and Aymer lost sight of
them entirely.
</p>

<p>
All that was known was that a few weeks after the acquittal, a waggon came and
fetched away their goods from the cottage, and Jenkins was heard of no
more—for the time. He had, in fact, found work, and buried himself, as he
hoped, for ever out of sight. There was a certain natural pride in him, and it
had been cruelly trampled upon. Suffer what he might, he would not ask for
aid—not even from Violet. And he did suffer—he and his poor
shattered wife. With not exactly a bad character, but the stigma of
“murder” clinging to him, he wandered about seeking work, and
nearly starved.
</p>

<p>
Even in Bury Wick, where he was so well-known, had he returned, he would have
found a certain amount of reluctance to receive him into the old grooves. In
distant villages where the dreadful tale of blood had penetrated, and where the
people had had little or no opportunity of hearing the facts, there was still a
strong prejudice against him; and it must be owned that from an
outsider’s point of view, it <i>did</i> look suspicious that he should
have been alone near the house when the deed was committed. So it was that he
found it hard to get employment, especially now the winter was come, and labour
less in demand.
</p>

<p>
At length, worn-out and exhausted with hunger and wandering, he accepted the
wages of a boy from Albert Herring, and a waggon was sent to fetch his goods.
</p>

<p>
Albert Herring had the reputation of being a hard master, and it was well
deserved. Hard work, long hours, small pay, and that given grudgingly, and
withheld on trivial pretences—these were the practices which gained for
him the hatred of the labouring population. Yet with singular inconsistency
they were always willing to work for him. This is a phenomenon commonly to be
observed—the worst of masters can always command plenty of men.
</p>

<p>
With Jenkins it was a matter of necessity. If he could not get work he must
starve or go into the union—dreaded almost as much as the prison. Albert
kept him several days after his application—he would see about
it—he was in no hurry. He laid much stress upon the gardener’s age,
though the other assured him that willingness would compensate for that Jenkins
had been a gardener, not a labourer. It was doubtful if he would understand his
duties if he was put on to cut a hedge.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, yes!” said the old man, eagerly; “I can use an axe or a
bill-hook.”
</p>

<p>
“Ay, ay,” said Albert, brutally. “Thee can <i>use a
bill-hook</i>, so I’ve heard say.”
</p>

<p>
Jenkins bowed his head, and his lip quivered.
</p>

<p>
The upshot was that he was put on at nine shillings per week—one shilling
to be deducted for rent of a small cottage.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Eleven.</h3>

<p>
This trial of poor Jenkins took up Aymer’s time, so that he had no
leisure for his new book, which had to be laid aside; and when he was in hopes
of returning to it, another incident again interrupted him. The work he had to
do was very little after all; it was not the amount, but the character of it,
that he disliked.
</p>

<p>
Yet, notwithstanding his hatred of the law, he could not help imbibing some
small smattering which afterwards proved extremely serviceable. The change from
World’s End was also beneficial in another manner—it opened his
eyes to much that he had never suspected. If anything, his inclination hitherto
would have been to have taken most people pretty much at their word. This may
sound childish to the young men of the period, who—in the habit of
frequenting billiard saloons, horse-races, card parties, hotels, and all places
where people congregate—naturally pick up a good deal of knowledge of the
world sufficient to astonish their parents, at all events.
</p>

<p>
Aymer certainly was not a model young man. Without a doubt, if he had been
placed where such amusements were easily accessible, he would have done much as
others of his age did; but it so happened that living at World’s End,
entirely out of society, he had no such opportunities. After a month or so at
Broughton’s office his eyes began to open, and he saw that things are
very different under the surface to what they appear outwardly. He became less
ready to accept what people said, or did in the sense they wished others to see
them, and commenced a habit of deducting a large percentage from the price they
put upon themselves.
</p>

<p>
He had been three times to see Violet—staying only a few hours—and
was agreeably surprised with the pleasant reception he received from Lady
Lechester, who took an opportunity of informing him privately that she wished
Violet to continue with her. Violet was well, but dull. She was no sentimental
heroine to pine away at separation from Aymer; but it was only natural that she
should miss the old associations. Particularly she begged Aymer not to overwork
himself at night with his private labour.
</p>

<p>
Lady Lechester seconded this, saying that she had known a gentleman who, much
of the same disposition as Aymer, had lost his wits through incessant
application. He was a relation of hers, and was now confined in an asylum at
Stirmingham. To save speculation, it will be as well to at once mention that
this person was not Odo Lechester.
</p>

<p>
Aymer’s reply was that he feared he should never complete his book, for
something always seemed to happen to delay it, and now he should soon have to
accompany Mr Broughton to Stirmingham.
</p>

<p>
It was in this way. Mr Broughton, before removing to Barnham, where he
inherited the practice and most of the fortune of a deceased uncle, had lived
in Stirmingham, working as the junior partner in a firm there. He was no longer
a partner, but still continued on friendly relations with the firm; and having
much confidence in his ability, they frequently sent for him in difficult
cases.
</p>

<p>
Now this firm—Messrs Shaw, Shaw, and Simson—had one very good
client, who had been to them almost equal to an estate, bringing in a yearly
income, and paying cash without dispute. This client, or rather these clients,
was one of those very building societies which had leased old Sternhold
Baskette’s incomplete houses for a term of years.
</p>

<p>
House property is, as every one knows, fruitful in causes of
litigation—repairs, defaulting tenants, disputes, and what not; and, in
addition, there is the task of collecting the rents, and a vast variety of
smaller pickings. All these Shaw, Shaw, and Simson had enjoyed for fully half a
century, till they had come to look upon them as their legitimate right, and as
certain to descend into the hands of their successors. But as time went on,
they began to get anxious, and to perceive that there was a great deal of truth
in the ancient maxim, “This too shall pass away,” for the term of
the lease, long as it was, rapidly approached expiration.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, it was their interest to delay the delivering up of the property to
the heir, John Marese Baskette, as long as possible; and they felt the stake to
be so great, that they did not spare their own money in the effort to oust him
from his just claim.
</p>

<p>
Messrs Shaw, Shaw, and Simson were all three old and experienced men—safe
men, in every sense; but they hesitated to trust entirely to their own
ingenuity in this complicated business. They had, in fact, entrusted it to Mr
Broughton, who was not only more energetic, but was full of resources which
would never have occurred to such steady persons as the three partners.
</p>

<p>
So it happened that, as the fall of the year advanced, Broughton had his hands
full of the building societies’ business, and had engaged to proceed to
Stirmingham as their legal representative, at the great family council of the
claimants in the Sternhold Hall, which was to open in three or four days.
</p>

<p>
Another circumstance that brought Aymer into still closer contact with the
great case, was the fact that this firm of Shaw, Shaw, and Simson had an
American client, who was himself one of the claimants. His name was another
variation upon the old stem.
</p>

<p>
Anthony Baskelette was tolerably well to do. He had a great business, and had
large transactions with manufacturers in Stirmingham. These necessitated an
agent there, and Shaw, Shaw, and Simson had for years looked after his affairs.
He was one of the Original Swampers. He really could prove his direct descent
from one of old Will Baskette’s cousins, and held ample documentary
evidence; and being moderately wealthy, thought he would have a trial at the
monster estate at Stirmingham. He instructed Shaw, Shaw, and Simson to get up
his claim in a legal form, and announced his intention of accompanying the body
of the claimants to England in the steamer <i>Lucca</i>, which had been so
generously chartered by Marese.
</p>

<p>
All the correspondence from him to Shaw and Company was sent on to Barnham; and
in this way Aymer, who had much to do with Broughton’s correspondence,
began to have some idea of the magnitude of the interests at stake. Though
constitutionally averse to the law, and hating its formalities, he could not
help feeling some considerable excitement about this tremendous case, and
perhaps showed more genuine alacrity in executing Broughton’s
instructions relating to it, than he had with other matters.
</p>

<p>
At all events, Broughton told him that he should want him to act as his clerk,
or notary, during his approaching visit to Stirmingham. The lawyer had begun to
feel a certain amount of trust and confidence in Aymer, who never failed to
fulfil his orders, though obviously against the grain, and especially as
Aymer’s demeanour was quiet and gentlemanly. If he did venture to throw
out a suggestion, it was in the most respectful and diffident manner.
</p>

<p>
In this way it happened that Aymer became well up in the <i>latter</i> part of
the history of Stirmingham, especially in that section of the case which
concerned the Baskettes, and in time it grew to be almost the leading thought
in his mind. His letters to Violet were full of it. The history was so
romantic—so extraordinary, and yet so true—that it took strong hold
upon his imagination.
</p>

<p>
He looked forward with pleasure to his approaching visit to Stirmingham. Like
all men with any pretence to brains, though he delighted in Nature and loved
the country, there was a strong, almost irresistible, desire within him to
mingle in the vast crowds of cities, to feel that indefinable
“life” which animates the mass. A great city to such a man as Aymer
was like a wonderful book—an Arabian Night’s tale, an endless
romance which would afford inexhaustible pleasure in the study of its
characteristics.
</p>

<p>
Though it would involve at least a month’s absence from Violet, he looked
forward to the visit with impatience—not without a secret hope that he
might in some unexpected manner find a chance of rising in the scale, and
getting a little nearer to the object of his life.
</p>

<p>
He had a number of commissions to execute for Lady Lechester—particularly
one. This was to search the old bookstalls and the curiosity shops, in
out-of-the-way corners, for antique Bibles. Agnes had a weakness, if it may be
so-called, for collecting old editions of the Bible, and possessed a large and
extremely interesting library filled with them. One or two particularly rare
copies had hitherto escaped her search, and if there was such a thing to be
found in Stirmingham she felt sure that Aymer would be precisely the man to
find it.
</p>

<p>
He had also a commission to purchase for her a few pictures, with which to
decorate the walls of a new wing she was adding to The Towers. She had a
curious dislike to the old family mansion, and yet wished to live in the
neighbourhood from a sense of duty. She held it as a doctrine that the owners
of large estates should pass a part of their time, at all events, at
home—there were so many ways in which they could do good, not only by
charity, but by encouraging local industries.
</p>

<p>
The new wing was being built to enable her to reside at home, and yet gratify
the innate dislike to The Towers which she cherished. Aymer’s artistic
taste was so marked that she felt confident he would select her suitable
pictures. There were plenty of old paintings in the galleries of The Towers
which could have been spared for the new wing, but she preferred to be
surrounded with fresh objects, even down to the very footstool.
</p>

<p>
The day for the assembling of the great family council came nearer and nearer,
and the letters from Anthony Baskelette more frequent. The daily papers, which
Aymer saw now and read with the closest attention, began to devote a space to
notes upon the preparations, and some sent specials to Stirmingham in advance,
who described the city in a series of sketches, which excited Aymer’s
curiosity to the highest pitch.
</p>

<p>
News came at last that the claimants were assembling at Imola; then the date of
the sailing of the <i>Lucca</i> came and passed. They knew that she must sail
upon that day, because her owners were under contract to deliver the bullion
entrusted to them on a fixed date in London, where its approaching arrival had
already had an appreciable effect upon the money-market. Seven hundred thousand
pounds in coin, in gold bars and Mexican dollars, is a sum which cannot be
transferred from one country to another at once, without causing some
fluctuations upon the Exchange. The owners of the <i>Lucca</i> were under a
bond by which they forfeited a heavy sum if the vessel did not start to time.
Therefore there was no doubt that the <i>Lucca</i> had sailed, though no
announcement had reached London of the event, for it happened that the Atlantic
cables were out of order, and there were not then such a number of cables as at
present. Still, no one doubted for an instant that she was upon the seas; and
one well-known illustrated paper announced that a special artist of theirs was
on board, who, the moment he landed, would present the public with sketches of
the incidents of the voyage, portraits of the claimants, and other subjects of
interest. It was also generally understood that the heir, in his yacht, had
started from New York to accompany the steamer.
</p>

<p>
What was Aymer’s surprise and regret, upon opening the paper on the
second morning after, to see the following telegram, one of the cables having
got into partial working order again:—
</p>

<p class="letter">
“New York, Tuesday Night.<br />
    “The <i>Lucca</i> sailed on Friday at noon, but <i>without</i> the
claimants. She brings the specie announced.”
</p>

<p>
Then there was an editorial note to the effect that several other words of the
telegram could not be read, on account of the unsatisfactory state of the
wires. The evening papers had further particulars:—
</p>

<p class="letter">
“The <i>Lucca</i>, and the yacht of John Marese Baskette, Esq, have
passed Sandy Hook. All well. A snow-storm blocked the line from Imola to New
York, and the claimants could not arrive in time. They follow per
<i>Saskatchewan</i>.”
</p>

<p>
Next day additional particulars came to hand. It appeared that the heir,
Marese, had on the Wednesday gone to Imola, and received an ovation from the
assembled claimants. He was to accompany them to New York on the Friday, and to
follow the <i>Lucca</i> in his yacht. On Thursday night there came a heavy fall
of snow—and a strong wind, which caused immense drifts. Notwithstanding
these the special train, with Marese and one hundred and fifty claimants,
started from Imola with a pilot-engine in front, the station-masters along the
line having telegraphed that they would clear it in time. They did partially
succeed in the attempt; but the storm came on again, the wires were blown down;
and telegraphic communication for a part of the way interrupted.
</p>

<p>
In the thick snow the special crept along, with the pilot in front; but,
despite of all their caution, the pilot-engine ran into a drift and stuck fast.
The special came up, but there was no collision. To proceed was, however,
impossible; every moment made it more so, and they began to fear lest the
return to Imola should be also blocked up.
</p>

<p>
After much consultation it was decided to run back to Imola, and proceed by a
more circuitous route. There was just a chance that, if this other route was
clear of snow, they might get to New York in time. They put on steam and pushed
as fast as possible, and the consequence was a narrow escape from a serious
disaster. The wind, since they had passed, had blown down a large pine tree,
which fell across the line. The engine of the special struck this tree, but
being provided with cow-guards, was not thrown off the line. Some of the
machinery was, however, damaged, and the special came to a standstill. After a
long delay, consequent on the interruption of telegraphic communication, a
second train was sent up, and the passengers re-embarked in it, and at last got
back to Imola. It was now, however, too late to reach New York in time,
especially as the longer route was equally encumbered with drifts of snow. The
result was that the <i>Lucca</i> was obliged to start without them.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Twelve.</h3>

<p>
The <i>Saskatchewan</i> was to start on the next Friday. The claimants had
arrived at New York on the Sunday, after much trouble and a long journey,
having to make an immense détour. The council could not now hold its
first meeting on New Year’s Day, but was expected to assemble on the 6th
January (Twelfth Day).
</p>

<p>
For two days they were without intelligence at Barnham and Stirmingham, the
cables being wrong again, but on the third Aymer was sent for to the private
residence of Mr Broughton at seven in the morning. The London dailies had not
yet arrived, but he had received a private telegram from Shaw, Shaw, and
Simson, with the most extraordinary news. The yacht of Mr Marese Baskette had
brought the steamship <i>Lucca</i> back to port a derelict, having found her
helpless on the high seas, with every passenger and every one of the crew dead.
</p>

<p>
Presently the papers came and contained the same announcement, though they one
and all expressed a strong doubt as to the accuracy of the news. By-and-by down
came a second edition of the <i>Telegraph</i>, repeating the former telegram,
with additional particulars. By night it was known as a fact over the length
and breadth of the world, that the <i>Lucca</i> had been found lying like a log
upon the waste of waters with a crew of corpses—a veritable ship of the
Dead. The ghastly news was only too true. Excitement rose to the highest pitch;
edition after edition of the papers sold out; men congregated in groups,
discussing this new horror which had saddened civilisation. All were completely
in the dark as to how it had happened, and in the eagerness for further insight
the brief telegram announcing that the claimants had started on board the
<i>Saskatchewan</i> was overlooked. There were plenty, however, who pointed out
to each other the fortunate escape the claimants had had. If the snow had not
fallen on that particular night; if the wires had not been broken by the
falling posts; if the pine tree had fallen on one side instead of crossing the
line, they would in all human probability have one and all shared the fate of
those on board the <i>Lucca</i>.
</p>

<p>
Only one circumstance caused any abatement of the intense alarm which this
fearful occurrence created. It was this: The greater portion of the space
allotted for passenger accommodation on the <i>Lucca</i> had been taken by
Marese for the claimants, and as it was not certain up to the last moment
whether they would come or not, the ship started with less than a third of her
full complement of passengers. There was not, therefore, such a death-roll as
might have been; but, even as it was, it was extended enough.
</p>

<p>
No one could understand how it had happened; not the slightest explanation was
given, and the public mind was exercised in speculating upon the cause of the
disaster. The passage from America to England had long lost the character of a
voyage. The height to which perfection had been carried in the great steamship
lines, was such that it had become a mere ocean promenade. No one thought of
danger; the perils of the deep had been so thoroughly overcome. In the midst of
this security came a shattering blow, which dispelled the confidence slowly
built up by such an expenditure of skill and money as had perhaps never been
equalled in the history of the world. The mystery seemed impenetrable. If the
vessel had disappeared like the <i>City of Boston</i>; if it had sunk, there
would have been several explanations possible. But to be brought back into port
perfect, uninjured, and yet a derelict, with a dead crew—it was
inexplicable.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Saskatchewan</i> arrived on the 2nd January, and with her came the
claimants—all but Marese—and these immediately proceeded to
Stirmingham. It was hoped that she would have brought fuller particulars as to
the fate of the <i>Lucca</i>; but having started on the very day that the
<i>Lucca</i> returned to port, nothing more was known on board than the simple
fact.
</p>

<p>
On the 4th, however, another steamer came into Liverpool, bringing the New York
papers up to date, and the contents of these were at once published in London.
</p>

<p>
By the steamer came a letter from Anthony Baskelette. He had left the
<i>Saskatchewan</i> on hearing of the <i>Lucca’s</i> return, in great
anxiety about some consignment he had made by her to his agent in Stirmingham.
He had met the heir, and had been invited to accompany him to England on board
his yacht, which would not reach Liverpool till the 9th. He was full of the
<i>Lucca</i> catastrophe, and his long letter contained more particulars than
four papers.
</p>

<p>
Aymer read it with the deepest interest. It ran:—
</p>

<p>
“You will of course attend the council on the 6th, both in the interest
of the building society and of myself. I am delayed by the necessity of seeing
after the consignment I had made on board the unfortunate <i>Lucca</i>, which
consignment is too valuable to be left to agents. I am in the greatest anxiety,
because it is uncertain yet in what light the rescue of the <i>Lucca</i> will
be regarded.
</p>

<p>
“There can be no doubt that if the owner of the yacht—Mr Marese
Baskette—likes, he can put in a heavy claim for salvage. The question
is—whether in his position as the ostensible heir, and as a gentleman, he
will insist upon his right, or, at all events, moderate his demands?
</p>

<p>
“I have met and conversed with him, and I gather from him that personally
he is averse to making any claim at all. He considers that his yacht simply
performed a duly, and a duly that was imperative upon her captain. To take
money from those unfortunate persons who had consigned goods, or bullion in the
<i>Lucca</i> he thought would be contrary to every sentiment of honour and
humanity.
</p>

<p>
“But, unfortunately, he is not altogether a free agent. It appears that
at the time when the salvage of the <i>Lucca</i> was effected, there was on
board the yacht a certain Mr Theodore Marese—a cousin of Mr
Baskette’s, who is only in moderate circumstances, and naturally looks
upon the event as a windfall which may never occur again—as I hope and
pray it never will.
</p>

<p>
“Mr Theodore Marese, it seems, performed some personal service in
rescuing the <i>Lucca</i>, and was considered to have run considerable risk to
his life.
</p>

<p>
“A certain sum will have no doubt to be paid to Mr Theodore, and I cannot
blame him if he insists upon his right. He was practically the master of the
yacht at the time, and it seems was on his way—with Mr Baskette’s
permission—to London, to attend to some very urgent business there, which
the catastrophe of the <i>Lucca</i> has delayed and greatly injured, causing
him pecuniary loss.
</p>

<p>
“Then there is the captain of the yacht, and the crew. It is a fine
vessel—some 300 tons or more, I should think—a screw steamer, and
very fast. She carries a rather numerous crew, and all these are ravenous for
plunder, and it is hard to see how these claims are to be avoided. Still
further, it seems that Mr Baskette himself is not altogether a free agent. He
freely admitted to me that he was not without his debts—as is probable
enough to a man of fashion, with a certain position to maintain.
</p>

<p>
“These creditors may take advantage of the <i>Lucca</i> business to push
him, and say that he must take the salvage in order to meet their demands. Of
this he is greatly afraid.
</p>

<p>
“Baskette is a most pleasant man, easy to converse with, very open and
straightforward—quite a different person to what I should have expected.
He has been particularly agreeable to me, promising his best efforts to curtail
my loss, and has given me a cabin in his now famous yacht, the <i>Gloire de
Dijon</i>.
</p>

<p>
“I cannot drive the subject of the salvage from my mind. The saloons,
bars, hotels—everywhere people talk of nothing else. It has quite
eclipsed the tragedy, as well it might, from the magnitude of the sums
involved.
</p>

<p>
“First of all, there is the vessel herself—found upon the high
seas, a derelict, without a hand at the wheel or at the engines. She is a
splendid steamer, fully 3000 tons, and estimated at half a million of dollars,
or, say, 100,000 pounds. The cargo she carried was immensely valuable—the
bullion you know about: it was 718,000 pounds in exact figures—but the
cargo must be worth at least another 75,000 pounds.
</p>

<p>
“Then there is a very large amount of personal property, for half the
claimants who were to go by her had forwarded their luggage previously; and
there are the effects of the poor creatures who died. But these last, Mr
Baskette declares, shall under no circumstances be touched. Happen what may,
they are to be returned to the owners of their heirs undiminished.
</p>

<p>
“Putting it all at the lowest estimate, the value of the vessel, the
bullion, and cargo cannot be less than 893,000 pounds; and the salvage will
equal a gigantic fortune.
</p>

<p>
“So far I have dealt only with the salvage question. I will now proceed
to give you a more detailed account than you will be able to get from the
papers, of the terrible fate which overtook the <i>Lucca</i>. These I have
learnt from Mr Baskette and from Mr Theodore Marese, who was on the yacht.
</p>

<p>
“The reporters are, of course, incessant in their inquiries, but there is
much that has escaped them, as a certain amount of reticence must of necessity
be observed. These gentlemen have, however, made no reserve to me—I must
beg of you not to publish this letter, or any part of it, lest there should
appear to be a breach of confidence.
</p>

<p>
“It appears that the <i>Lucca</i> started at noon on the Friday, as per
bond, with a full complement of crew, but a short list of passengers. About two
hours after she had left, the <i>Gloire de Dijon</i> put out to sea. Mr
Baskette was at that time still at Imola, unable to get to New York. He and his
cousin, Mr T. Marese, were to have gone together in the yacht to London, where
Mr Theodore’s business was very pressing.
</p>

<p>
“When Mr Baskette found himself unable to reach New York, he telegraphed
to Mr Theodore telling him to take the yacht and go on to London as had been
previously arranged, thereby showing the same character of consideration for
others which he has since exhibited to me.
</p>

<p>
“Mr Theodore put to sea in the <i>Gloire de Dijon</i>, and says that next
morning they overtook the <i>Lucca</i>, or nearly so, the yacht being extremely
swift. It occurred to him that, after all, as the Atlantic is still the
Atlantic, notwithstanding steam, and there are such things as breaking
machinery, it would be well to keep in company with a powerful vessel like the
<i>Lucca</i> as far as the coast of Ireland.
</p>

<p>
“They did so, and even once spoke the steamship, which replied,
‘All well.’ All that day the two ships were not half a mile apart,
and the night being moonlit, the <i>Gloire de Dijon</i> followed close in the
other’s wake till about four in the morning, when, as often happens at
thick fog came on. Afraid of collision, the captain of the yacht now slackened
speed to about six knots, and kept a course a little to the starboard of the
steamer ahead.
</p>

<p>
“The fog continued very thick till past noon, and then suddenly lifted,
and they saw seven or eight sail in sight, one of which was the <i>Lucca</i> on
their port bow, and about four miles off. She was running, as usual, at a good
pace, and the sea being quiet, was making all thirteen knots. The <i>Gloire de
Dijon</i> increased speed, and drew up to within a mile and a half by three in
the afternoon. The <i>Lucca</i> then bore due east, and they were in her wake.
The wind was west, with a little southerly, and just ahead of the <i>Lucca</i>
was a large square-rigged ship, with all sail set, but making very little way
on account of the trifling breeze.
</p>

<p>
“An extraordinary thing now happened. The <i>Lucca</i> was observed by
the captain of the yacht to be making straight for the sailing ship ahead, and
had now got so close that a collision appeared inevitable. He called to Mr
Theodore, who came up from below. The <i>Lucca</i> ran dead at the sailing
ship, though she was making thirteen knots to the other’s four, and the
slightest turn of her wheel would have carried her free. On account of the
direction of the wind, the ship was sailing almost right before it, and the
steamer appeared to be aiming at her stern.
</p>

<p>
“On the yacht they could see the crew of the sailing ship making frantic
signs over the quarter to the steamer, but not the slightest notice was taken.
The captain of the sailing ship had relied upon the steamer giving way, as is
usual, and had allowed her to come so close that, it seems, he lost his head.
Seeing this, the mate sang out to put the helm a-starboard, and run straight
before the wind. This was done, and only just in time, for the steamer actually
grazed her quarter, and carried away their boom. Knowing that the captain of
the <i>Lucca</i> was an old sailor, and a steady, experienced man, they were
astonished at this behaviour, especially as, without staying to inquire what
damage had been done, she kept on her course at still greater speed.
</p>

<p>
“The captain of the yacht now put on speed, being desirous of speaking
the steamer; but after an hour or two it was evident that the <i>Lucca</i> was
drawing ahead, and had increased her lead by at least a mile. They could not
understand this, as the yacht was notoriously faster, and it became evident
that the engineer of the <i>Lucca</i> must have got his safety-valve
screwed-down.
</p>

<p>
“Night, as every one knows, falls rapidly at this time of the year, and
the darkness was increased by the fog, which now came on again. During the
evening all their conversation was upon the <i>Lucca</i>. Surely she would not
keep up her speed in such a fog as this? The yacht had slackened, and was
doing, as before, about six knots.
</p>

<p>
“The night wore on, till about two o’clock, when the wind
freshened, and blew half a gale. At four the fog cleared, and the watch
reported that the <i>Lucca</i> was on their starboard quarter, a mile astern,
with her engines stopped. Mr Theodore was called, and came on deck. There lay
the steamer in the trough of the sea, rolling, heaving—so much so that
they wondered her sticks did not go. No smoke issued from her funnel, and the
steam-pipe gave no sign. The usual flag was flying, but no signal was shown in
answer to the <i>Gloire de Dijon’s</i> inquiry. There was no sail on her.
</p>

<p>
“It was at once evident that something was wrong, and Mr Theodore ordered
the yacht to be put about. They tried the signals, but, as I said, no notice
was taken. On approaching the <i>Lucca</i>, which had to be done with some
caution, as she slewed about in a helpless manner, and was drifting before the
sea, an extraordinary spectacle presented itself. As she rolled, her deck came
partly into view, and they saw, with what feelings may be imagined, several men
lying on the deck, and thrown now this way, now that, as the rollers went under
her, evidently either dead or unconscious.
</p>

<p>
“Filled with alarm and excitement, they attempted to board the vessel,
but found it impossible. The waves made all but a clean breach over her. She
staggered like a drunken man, and swung now this way, now that. Some of the
standing rigging had given way, and they could hear the masts creak. They were
afraid to get under her lee in case they should fall.
</p>

<p>
“At length the captain of the yacht thought of a plan. He got a hawser
ready with a loop, and watching his opportunity, ran the yacht close to her
bow, and with his own hand, at great risk, hurled the rope, and by good luck
the loop caught in the fluke of one of her anchors. They paid the hawser out
over the yacht’s stern, and gradually got her in tow. It strained
fearfully; but as soon as they had got the <i>Lucca</i> before the wind, they
had her right enough, though there was even then some danger of being pooped.
The sea was high, but not so high that the jolly-boat could live, and they
manned her and boarded the <i>Lucca</i>.
</p>

<p>
“The sailors were eager enough to get on board, but so soon as they were
on deck the superstition of the sea seemed to seize them, and not one would
venture from the gangway; for towards the stern there lay the bodies that they
had seen, still and motionless, and evidently dead.
</p>

<p>
“A terrible mystery hung over the ship—terrible, indeed!”
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Thirteen.</h3>

<p>
“Not one of the seamen could be got to go below, or to approach the
corpses on the deck; and even the mate, who did touch these last, had a
reluctance to descend. It was, however, necessary to get another hawser
attached to the <i>Lucca</i>, and this occupied some little time; and by then
the men became more accustomed to the ship, and at last, led by the mate, they
went down.
</p>

<p>
“At the foot of the staircase a terrible sight met their gaze. A heap of
people—seamen, passengers, all classes—lay huddled up
together—dead. They were piled one over the other in ghastly profusion,
having been probably flung about by the rolling of the ship when she got
broadside on. So great was the heap that they could not advance without either
stepping upon the bodies, or removing them; and in this emergency they
signalled to the yacht, which sent another boat, and in it came Mr Theodore.
</p>

<p>
“He at once gave orders to make a passage and to explore the steamer
thoroughly, which was done, and done speedily, for the sailors, having now
conquered their superstitious fears, worked with a will. From that heap
thirty-five bodies were carried up on deck, and laid upon one side in an awful
row. They exhibited no traces of violence whatever. Their faces were quite
calm; though one or two had the eyeballs staring from the head, as if they had
struggled to escape suffocation.
</p>

<p>
“A search through the steamer revealed a cargo of the dead. Passengers
lay at the doors of their berths, some half-dressed; and five or six were
discovered in their berths, having evidently died while asleep. The engineer
lay on the floor of the engine-room with three assistants—stiff, and with
features grimly distorted. They had apparently suffered more than the rest.
</p>

<p>
“The crew were found in various places. The captain lay near the
engine-room, as if he had been on his way to consult with the engineer when
death overtook him. Bodies were found all over the ship, and exclamations
constantly arose as the men discovered fresh corpses. The air between decks was
close and confined, and there was a fetid odour which they supposed to arise
from the bodies, and which forced them sometimes to run on deck to breathe.
This odour caused many of the sailors to vomit, and one or two were really ill
for a time.
</p>

<p>
“It appeared that the whole ship’s crew and all the passengers had
perished; but one of the sailors searching about found a man in the wheelhouse
on deck, who on being lifted up showed some slight trace of life. The sailors
crowded round, and the excitement was intense. Mr Theodore, who is a physician
by profession, lent the aid of his skill, and after a while the man began to
come round, though unable to speak.
</p>

<p>
“The captain of the yacht had now come on board, and a consultation was
held, at which it was decided to run back to New York. But as the wind was
strong and the sea high, and the hawsers strained a good deal, it was arranged
to put a part of the crew of the yacht on board the <i>Lucca</i>, to get up
steam in her boilers, and shape a course for the States. To this the crew of
the yacht strongly objected—they came aft in a body and respectfully
begged not to be asked to stay on board the <i>Lucca</i>. They dreaded a
similar fate to that which befel the crew and passengers of that unfortunate
steamer.
</p>

<p>
“The end of it was that Mr Theodore ordered the hawsers to be kept
attached, and the yacht was to partly tow the steamer and she was to partly
steam ahead herself—the steam was to be got up, and the engines driven at
half speed. This would ease the hawsers and the yacht, and at the same time the
crew on board the <i>Lucca</i> would be in communication with the yacht, and
able to convey their wishes at once.
</p>

<p>
“All agreed to this. Steam was easily got up, and the
<i>Lucca’s</i> boilers and her engines were soon working, for the
machinery was found to be in perfect order. By the time that this arrangement
was perfected, and the ships were, got well under weigh, the short day was
nearly over, and with the night came anew the superstitions of the sailors.
They murmured, and demurred to working a ship with a whole cargo of dead
bodies. They would not move even across the deck alone, and as to going below
it required them at once to face the mystery.
</p>

<p>
“After an hour or so a clamour arose to pitch the dead overboard. What on
earth was the use of keeping them? An abominable stench came up from between
decks, and many of them could barely stand it. Mr Theodore and the captain
begged them to be calm, but it was in vain. They rose <i>en masse</i>, and in a
short space of time every one of these dead bodies had been heaved overboard.
</p>

<p>
“The gale had moderated, and the splash of each corpse as it fell into
the water could be distinctly heard on board the yacht ahead. Such conduct
cannot be too much deplored, and there was a talk of prosecuting the men for
mutiny; but, on the other hand, there appears to be some excuse in the
extraordinary and unprecedented horrors of the situation.
</p>

<p>
“Mr Theodore remained on board the <i>Lucca</i>, doing all that science
and patience could do for the sole survivor, who proved to be the third
officer. Towards sunrise he rallied considerably, but Mr Theodore never had any
hopes, and advised the captain to take a note of his depositions, which was
done.
</p>

<p>
“His name, he said, was William Burrows, of Maine. He could only speak a
few sentences at a time, and that very faintly, but the substance of it was
that all went well with the <i>Lucca</i> up till early that morning, when first
the fog came on. Very soon after the mist settled down, and speed was reduced,
there was a commotion below, and a report spread through the ship that three
men were dying. In ten minutes half a dozen more were taken in this manner.
They complained merely of inability to breathe, and of a deadly weakness, and
prayed to be taken on deck. This was done; but then ten or twelve more were
affected, and those who went below to assist them up on deck fell victims at
once to the same strange disorder. Every one throughout the ship complained of
a faint, sickly odour, and no sooner was this inhaled than a deadly lethargy
seized upon them, and increased till they fell down and died. He happened to be
on deck in the wheelhouse at the time, and saw half a dozen sailors and three
of the passengers brought up, but remembered no more, for the sickly smell
invaded the deck. He heard a singing in his ears, and the blood seemed to press
heavily, as if driven upwards against the roof of his skull. He remembered no
more for some hours. Then he, as it were, awoke, and got up on his legs, but
again felt the same lethargy, and fell. When the disorder first attacked the
ship’s company, the captain talked of stopping the steamer and signalling
for assistance; but it appeared to be useless, for the fog was so thick that
any flag, or rocket, or light would have been unnoticed at half a cable’s
distance. Preparations were made to fire a gun, and the steam blast was
ordered, but the engineer was dead, and no one would go below. The captain then
descended to go to the engine-room, and was seen no more. Meantime the steamer
continued her way. When he got on his legs in the wheelhouse, it was just after
the bow of the <i>Lucca</i> had carried away the boom of an unknown sailing
ship, and he could feel that she was then going at a tremendous speed. The fog
had cleared, and if he had had strength enough he could have made signals, but
the deadly sleep came over him again, and he was unconscious till picked up by
the crew of the <i>Gloire de Dijon</i>.
</p>

<p>
“This was all he could tell, and it threw no light upon the cause of the
disaster. After he had signed this in a shaky hand—I have seen the
original document—he sank rapidly, and, despite of every remedy and
stimulant, died before noon. His body was the only one brought into port, and
it was interred yesterday in the presence of a vast assembly. A
<i>post-mortem</i> examination failed to detect the slightest trace of poison
or indication of disease; and all those who assisted in removing the dead
bodies on board the <i>Lucca</i>, declare that they presented no known symptoms
of any epidemic—for the prevailing belief in New York at first was that
some epidemic had broken out—a kind of plague, which destroyed its
victims almost as soon as attacked. But for this there seems no foundation
whatever. None of the sailors of the yacht caught the epidemic. One or two were
unwell for a day or so, but are now well and hearty.
</p>

<p>
“I think Mr Theodore’s suggestion the best that has been
made—and it gradually gains ground with educated men, though the mass
cling to the fanciful notion of foul play in some unheard-of way—Mr
Theodore thinks that it was caused by the generation of coal-damp, or some
similar and fatal gas, in the coal-bunkers of the <i>Lucca</i>; and everything
seems to favour this supposition. It is well-known that in cold
weather—especially in cold weather accompanied by fog—coal-damp in
mines is especially active and fatal. Most of the great explosions which have
destroyed hundreds at once have occurred in such a state of the atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
“Now the fog which came on that fatal morning was peculiarly thick and
heavy, and it so happens that the coal in the <i>Lucca’s</i> bunkers came
from a colliery where, only a fortnight ago, there was an explosion. The
vapour, or gas, or whatever it was that was thus generated, was not the true
coal-damp, or it would have been ignited by the furnaces of the boilers, or at
the cook’s fires; but in all probability it was something very near akin
to it. All the symptoms described by poor Burrows, are those of blood-poisoning
combined with suffocation, and such would be the effects of a gas or vapour
arising from coal. Fatal effects arising from damp coal in close bunkers are on
record; but this is the worst ever heard of.
</p>

<p>
“It would seem that after the engineer and the crew fell into their fatal
slumbers, the steam in the boilers must have reached almost a bursting
pressure—the boilers being untended—and the engineer, in falling,
had opened the valve to the full, which accounts for the extraordinary speed of
the <i>Lucca</i> when pursued by the yacht. Being a very long vessel and sharp
in the bows, and going at a very high speed, she would naturally keep nearly a
direct course, as there was little wind or sea to interfere with her rudder. So
soon as the fires burned out the engines stopped, and the sea rising, she
became entirely at the mercy of the waves.
</p>

<p>
“When Burrows fell a victim he saw nine or ten men on deck lying prone in
a fatal sleep—when the <i>Gloire de Dijon</i> sent a boat’s crew on
board there were but three bodies on deck; the rest had rolled, or been washed,
overboard.
</p>

<p>
“These are the principal particulars of this unprecedented catastrophe.
This is a long letter, but I am sure that you will be eager for news upon the
subject, and, to tell the truth, I cannot get it out of my mind, and it
relieves me to write it down.
</p>

<p>
“What a narrow escape we have all had. And especially me, for I came on
to New York from Imola before the rest started, and got clear through without
any snow. When it was found that they could not reach New York in time, I was
in doubt whether to go by the <i>Lucca</i>, or remain and accompany the main
body in the <i>Saskatchewan</i>. Accident decided. I met an old friend whom I
had not seen for years, and resolved to take advantage of the delay, and spend
a day or two with him. So I escaped.
</p>

<p>
“But had it not been for the snow-storm, which caused so much cursing at
the time, we should one and all have perished miserably. The impression made
upon us was so deep that just before the <i>Saskatchewan</i> started the whole
body of the claimants attended a special service at a church here, when
thanksgivings were offered for the escape they had had, and prayers offered up
for future safety.
</p>

<p>
“I look forward with much pleasure to my voyage in the <i>Gloire de
Dijon</i> yacht, at Mr Baskette’s invitation. A finer, more gentlemanly
man does not exist; and I am greatly impressed with the learning of Mr
Theodore.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer was much struck with the contents of this letter of Anthony
Baskelette’s. The whole tragedy seemed to pass before his mind; his vivid
imagination called up a picture of the <i>Lucca</i>, steaming as fast as
bursting pressure could drive her with a crew of corpses across the winter sea.
He made an extract from it, and sent it to Violet. Next day they were <i>en
route</i> for Stirmingham.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment the designer of this horrible event was steaming across the
Atlantic in his splendid yacht, gulling weak-minded, simple Baskelette with
highest notions of honour, and what not. When Marese found that the snow had
blocked the line and prevented access to New York, his rage and disappointment
knew no bounds; but he was sufficiently master of himself to think and decide
upon the course to be pursued.
</p>

<p>
Although that part of the diabolical scheme which aimed at the wholesale
destruction of the claimants had failed, all the other sections of it were in
train to succeed. The bullion was shipped, the cargo a rich one, the steamer
herself valuable—no better prize could ever fall to him. Therefore he
telegraphed to Theodore in cypher to proceed as had been arranged.
</p>

<p>
The infernal machine, concealed in the simple aspect of an ordinary strong
deal-box, was sent on board the <i>Lucca</i>, and everything happened just as
Theodore had foreseen. If the conspirators were somewhat disturbed in their
calculations by the snow-storm, on the other hand their designs were assisted
by the heavy fog which had occurred at sea. Undoubtedly this fog rendered the
poisonous gas escaping from the case still more effective, as it would prevent
it dispersing so rapidly, and at the same time it hid any signals the
<i>Lucca</i> might have made.
</p>

<p>
Nothing more fortunate for the conspirators than this fog could have happened,
for its service did not end here—it furnished a plausible explanation of
what would have otherwise been inexplicable.
</p>

<p>
Theodore easily contrived the removal of the fatal case, now empty, on board
the <i>Gloire de Dijon</i> after the <i>Lucca</i> had returned to port. The
case had been consigned to Liverpool, which was the port the <i>Lucca</i> was
bound for, and the excuse for sending it by the <i>Lucca</i> was all cut and
dried—i.e., that the <i>Gloire de Dijon</i> was for London.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was more natural than that, after this narrow escape, it should be
wished to transfer the case to the <i>Gloire de Dijon</i>. This was done; and
while at sea Theodore quietly removed his machine and pitched it into the water
at night, and it sank in the abyss, being lined with iron inside.
</p>

<p>
The question of salvage bid fair to occupy the Courts in New York for some
considerable time, and to be a boon to the lawyers; but the two conspirators
were far too keen to let their prize slip from them in that way. They managed
to have the matter referred to arbitration, and the final result was that
400,000 pounds was awarded. This amount they at once transferred to London, and
with it plunged at once into fresh schemes.
</p>

<h3>Fourteen.</h3>

<p>
The great city whose ownership was at stake, knew that the eagles were gathered
to the living carcase, and yet did not feel their presence. What are one
hundred and fifty people in a population of half a million? They are lost,
unless they march in order and attract attention by blocking up the streets.
Disband a regiment of the Line in Saint Paul’s Churchyard at London, and
in ten minutes it would disappear, and no one would notice any unusual
prevalence of red coats on the pavements.
</p>

<p>
The newspaper people were woefully disappointed, for the Press were not
admitted. They revenged themselves with caricature portraits of the claimants,
and grotesque sketches of their manners and conduct. Although the Press were
excluded; there were several present who could write shorthand, and amongst
these was a clerk from the office of Shaw, Shaw, and Simson, whose notes I have
had the opportunity of consulting.

<p>
The Sternhold Hall, in which the council was held, was built, as has been
stated, upon a spot once the very centre of the Swamp, now surrounded with
noble streets of mansions and club-houses, theatres,
picture-galleries—the social centre of Stirmingham. The front—you
can buy a photograph of it for a shilling—is of the Ionic order of
architecture—that is, the modern mock Ionic—i.e., the basement is
supported by columns of that order, and above these the <i>façade</i>
consists of windows in the Gothic style, which are, after all, dumb windows
only. The guide-books call it magnificent; it is really simply incongruous.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the first two days was spent by the one hundred and fifty
claimants in wrangling as to who should take the chair, how the business should
be conducted, who should be admitted and who should not. All the minor
differences suppressed while on the voyage broke out afresh, the moment the
eagles had scented the carcase. Two days’ glimpse at the wealth of
Stirmingham, was sufficient to upset all the artificial calm and friendship,
which had been introduced by the generous offers of Marese Baskette. One
gentleman proposed that a certain section of claimants should be wholly
excluded from the hall. This caused a hubbub, and if the incident had happened
in the States revolvers might have been used. The Original Swampers declared
that they would not sit under a chairman drawn from any other body but
themselves. The outer circle of Baskettes considered that the conceit of the
Swampers was something unbearable, and declined to support them in any way. The
Illegitimate Swampers alone supported the Originals, in the hope of getting up
by clinging to their coat-tails. The Primitive Sibbolds were quite as
determined to sit under no president but their own, and, the ranks of the other
Sibbolds were split up into twenty parties. The clamour of tongues, the
excitement, the hubbub was astounding.
</p>

<p>
Aymer, as clerk to Mr Broughton, had a first-rate view of the whole, for Shaw,
Shaw, and Simson had provided for the comfort of their representative by
purchasing for the time the right to use the stage entrance of the room. Their
offices were for the nonce established in the green-room. Their clients mounted
upon the platform or stage, and passed behind the curtain to private
consultation. This astute management upset the other seven companies, whose
representatives had to locate themselves as best they might in the midst of a
stormy sea of contending people. From the rear of the stage, just where the
stage-manager was accustomed to look out upon the audience and watch the effect
upon them of the play, Aymer had a good view of the crowd below, and beheld men
in every shade of cloth, with rolls of paper, yellow deeds, or old books and
quill pens in their hands, gesticulating and chattering like the starlings at
World’s End.
</p>

<p>
For two whole days the storm continued, till at last Mr Broughton suggested
that the debate should be conducted in sections; each party to have its own
president, secretary, committee, and reporter of progress; each to sit apart
from the others by means of screens, and that there should be a central
committee-room, to receive the reports and tabulate them in order. This scheme
was adopted, and something like order began to prevail. Anthony Baskelette,
Esq, who had now arrived per the <i>Gloire de Dijon</i>, was pretty unanimously
voted to the presidentship of the central committee, or section, the members of
which were composed of representatives from every party. Screens were provided
at no little expense, and the great hall was portioned out into thirty or forty
pens, not unlike the high pews used of old in village churches.
</p>

<p>
Aymer was intensely interested and amused, as he stood at his peep-hole on the
stage, from which he could see into every one of these pens, or pews, and watch
the eagerness of the disputes going on between the actors in each.
</p>

<p>
The first great object the sections had in view was to reduce their claims to
something like shape and order; for this purpose each section was numbered from
1 to 37, and was to deliver to the central section, Number 38, a report or
summary of the general principles and facts upon which the members of the
section based their claim. This summary of claim, as it was called, was to be
short, succinct, and clear; and to be supported by minute extracts of evidence,
by the vouchers of the separate individuals, so to say, showing that the
summary was correct.
</p>

<p>
These extracts of evidence attached to the summary were really not extracts,
but full copies, and had to contain the dates, names, method of identification,
and references to church registers, tombstones, family Bibles, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Aymer was astounded at the magnitude of these volumes of evidence—for
such, in fact, they were. He had an opportunity of just glancing at them, as
they were laid upon the table of the central section one after another. The
summaries were reasonable and tolerably well expressed. The minutes of evidence
were something overwhelming. A section would send up in the course of a
day—first, its summary and a pile of folios—seventy or eighty large
lawyer’s folios of evidence to be attached to it. On the morrow it would
beg for permission to add to its evidence, and towards the afternoon up would
come another huge bundle of closely-written manuscript.
</p>

<p>
This would go on for several days, till the central committee at last issued an
order to receive no more evidence from section Number —.
</p>

<p>
Then section Number — would hold an indignation meeting and protest, till
the central committee was obliged to receive additional bundles of so-called
evidence. Half of this evidence was nothing better than personal recollection.
</p>

<p>
The method pursued in the sections was delightfully simple and gratifying to
every member’s vanity. He was supplied with pen and ink, and told to put
down all he could recollect about his family. The result was that in each
section there were five or six people—and in some more—all busily
at work, writing autobiographies; and as everybody considered himself of quite
as much consequence as his neighbour, the bulk of these autobiographies can
easily be imagined.
</p>

<p>
If any one had taken the trouble to wade through these personal histories, he
would have been highly gratified with the fertility of the United States in
breeding truly benevolent, upright, and distinguished men!
</p>

<p>
Out of all that one hundred and fifty there was not one who did not merit the
gratitude of his township at least, and some were fully worthy of the
President’s chair at the White House. Their labours for the good of
others were most carefully recorded—the subscriptions they had made to
local charities far away on the other side of the Atlantic, to schoolhouses,
and chapels, town-halls, and what not.
</p>

<p>
“There,” ran many a proud record,—“you will see my
initials upon the corner-stone—‘J.I.B.,’ for ‘Jonathan
Ithuriel Baskette,’ and the date (186-), which is in itself good evidence
towards my case.”
</p>

<p>
All this mass of rubbish had to be sifted by the central, committee, to be
docketed, indexed, arranged, and a general analysis made of it.
</p>

<p>
They worked for a while without a murmur, and suddenly collapsed. It was
impossible to meet the flood of writing. Fancy one hundred and fifty people
writing their autobiographies all at once, and each determined to do himself
justice! Such a spectacle was never witnessed since the world began, and was
worthy of the nineteenth century. The central committee flung up their hands in
despair. A resource was presently found in the printing-press.
</p>

<p>
When once the idea was started, the cry spread to all corners of the hall, and
rose in a volume of sound to be echoed from the roof. The Press! The Spirit
evoked by Faust which he could not control, nor any who have followed him.
</p>

<p>
It was unanimously decided that everything should be printed—sectional
summaries, minutes of evidence, central committees analysis, solicitors
arguments, references and all. There was rejoicing in the printing offices at
Stirmingham that day. Now the <i>Stirmingham Daily Post</i> reaped the reward
of its long attack upon the family of the heir, upon Sternhold Baskette, and
Marese, his son. The contract was offered to the <i>Daily Post</i>, the
<i>Daily Post</i> accepted it, and set to work, but soon found it necessary to
obtain the aid of other local printers.
</p>

<p>
Now a new source of delay and worry arose. The moment everybody knew they were
going into print—why is it print sounds so much better than
manuscript?—each and all wanted to revise and add to their histories.
First, all the sections had to receive back their summaries and minutes of
evidence, to be re-written, corrected, revised, and above all extended. The
scribbling of pens recommenced with redoubled vigour, and now the
printer’s devils appeared upon the scene. The cost of printing the
enormous mass of verbiage must have been something immense, but it was
cheerfully submitted to—because each man looked forward to the pleasure
of seeing himself in print.
</p>

<p>
Acres upon acres of proofs went in and out of the Sternhold Hall, and meantime
Aymer grew impatient and weary of it. His time was much more occupied than at
Barnham. He had to conduct all Broughton’s correspondence, and when that
was finished lend a hand in arranging the minutes of evidence for the
committee, who had applied for assistance to the solicitors. He had only
reckoned on a month at Stirmingham at the outside. Already a fortnight had
elapsed, and there seemed no sign of the end.
</p>

<p>
His letters to Violet became tinged with a species of dull despair. All this
scribbling was to him the very acme of misery, the very winter of
discontent—meaningless, insufferable. There was no progress in it for
him: he could not find a minute’s spare time now to proceed with his
private work. Not a step was gained nearer Violet.
</p>

<p>
When at last the scribbling was over; when the proofs had been read and re-read
and corrected till the compositors went mad; then the speechifying had to
begin. This to Aymer was even more wearisome than the other. For Mr Broughton
having discovered his literary talent, employed him to listen to the debate and
write a daily <i>précis</i> of its progress, which it would be less
trouble to him to read than the copious and interminable notes of the shorthand
writer.
</p>

<p>
This order compelled Aymer to pay close attention to every speech from first to
last; and as they one and all followed the American plan of writing out their
speeches and reading them, most were of inordinate length. To suit the speakers
a new arrangement of the hall had to be made. The screens were now removed, and
the sections placed in a kind of semi-circle, with the central section in
front. Those who desired to speak gave in their names, and were called upon by
the president in regular rotation.
</p>

<p>
The first subject discussed was the method to be pursued. Some recommended that
the whole body of claimants should combine and present their claims <i>en
masse</i>. Others thought that this plan might sacrifice those who had good
claims to those who had bad ones. Many were for forming a committee, chosen
from the various sections, to remain in England and instruct the solicitors;
others were for forming at once a committee of solicitors.
</p>

<p>
After four or five days of fierce discussion the subject was still unsettled,
and a new one occupied its place. This was—how should the plunder be
divided? Such a topic seemed to outsiders very much like reckoning the chickens
before they were hatched. But not so to these enthusiastic gentlemen. They were
certain of wresting the properly from the hands of the
“Britishers,” who had so long kept them out of their
rights—the Stars and Stripes would yet float over the city of
Stirmingham, and the President of the United States should be invited to a
grand dinner in that very hall!
</p>

<p>
The division of the property caused more dissension than everything else taken
together. One section—that of the Original Swampers—declared that
it <i>would</i> have, nothing should prevent its having, the whole of the
streets, etc, built on the site of the Swamp. The Sibbolds cared not a rap for
the Swamp; they <i>would</i> have all the property which had grown upon the
site of old Sibbold’s farm at Wolfs Glow. The Illegitimates claimed
pieces here and there, corresponding to the islands of the Swamp. Some one
proposed that the meeting should be provided with maps of Stirmingham, and the
idea was unanimously adopted.
</p>

<p>
Then came the day of the surveyors. One vast map was ordered—it had to be
made in sections—and was estimated to cover, when extended, a mile in
length by three hundred yards in breadth; and then it did not satisfy some of
the claimants. Then followed a terrible wrangle over the maps. Everybody wanted
to mark his possession upon it with red ink, and these red ink lines invariably
interfered with one another. One gentleman proposed, with true American
ingenuity, to have the map traced in squares—like the outlying
territories and backwoods of America—and to assign to each section a
square! But this was too equal a mode to satisfy the more grasping.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it was resolved that all the minutes of evidence should be gone
through by the central committee, and that they should sketch out those
portions of the city to which each section was entitled. This took some time.
At the end of that time the great Sternhold Hall presented an extraordinary
spectacle. The walls of the hall, from the ceiling to the floor, and all round,
and the very ceiling itself, were papered with these sections of the map, each
strongly marked with lines in red ink. Near the stage there was a vast library
of books, reaching half-way to the ceiling; this was composed of the summaries,
minutes of evidence, etc.
</p>

<p>
All round the room wandered the claimants in knots of two or three, examining
their claims as marked upon the sections of the map. Many had opera-glasses to
distinguish the claims which were “skyed;” some affected to lie
down on their backs and examine the ceiling with telescopes; scores had their
volume of evidence in their hands, and were trying to discover upon what
principle the central committee had apportioned out the city.
</p>

<p>
Of course there was a general outcry of dissatisfaction—one section had
too much, another too little, and some sections, it was contended, had no right
to any. The meeting then resolved that each section should visit the spaces
marked out for its claim, and should report to the central committee upon its
value. Away went the sections, and there might have been seen five or six
gentlemen in one street, and ten or twelve round the corner, with maps and
pencils, talking eagerly, and curiously scanning the shops and
houses—poking their noses into back courts and alleys—measuring the
frontage of club-houses and theatres. The result was an uproar, for each
section declared that the other had had a more valuable portion of the city
given to it; and one utterly rejected its section, for it had got the
Wolf’s Glow district—the lowest den in Stirmingham!
</p>

<p>
After a long discussion, it was at last arranged that each section should
retain, <i>pro tem</i>, its claim as marked out, and that <i>token the property
was realised</i>, any excess of one section over the other should be equally
divided. These people actually contemplated the possibility of putting the city
up to auction! To such lengths will the desire of wealth drive the astutest of
men, blinding their eyes to their own absurdity.
</p>

<p>
After these preliminary points were settled, the meeting at last resolved
itself into a committee of the whole house, and proceeded to business. The
first business was to verify the evidence. This necessitated visits to the
churches, and public record office to make extracts, etc, and two days were set
apart for that purpose. It was a rich harvest for the parish clerks of
Stirmingham, and especially for the fortunate clerk at Wolf’s Glow. After
this the meeting, beginning to be alarmed at the enormous expense it had
incurred, resolved on action, and with that object it decided to hold a secret
session, and to exclude all persons not strictly claimants.
</p>

<p>
This relieved Aymer from his wearisome task of chronicling the proceedings; but
he could not leave or get a day to visit Violet. As he left the hall he stopped
a moment to look at the stock-in-trade of an itinerant bookseller, who had
established his track in front of the building since the family congress began.
His stock was principally genealogical, antiquarian, and
topographical—mostly old rubbish, that no one would imagine to be worth a
sixpence, and yet which, among a certain class, commands a good sale.
</p>

<p>
The title of a more modern-looking volume caught Aymer’s eye. It was
“A Fortune for a Shilling,” and consisted of a list of unclaimed
estates, next of kin, persons advertised for, etc. He weighed it in his
hand—it tempted him; yet he despised himself for his weakness. But
Violet? He should serve her best by saving his shilling. He put it down, and
went his way.
</p>

<h3>Fifteen.</h3>

<p>
Their mouths watered for the great city, yet it seemed no nearer to them than
when three thousand miles away on the other side of the Atlantic. They talked
loudly of their rights, but there was the little difficulty of possession,
which is sometimes a trifle more than nine points of the law. I have conversed
with unreasonable members of a certain Church, which claims to be universal,
who considered that half England—half the vast domains owned by lords and
ladies, by the two hundred and fifty proprietors of Great Britain—was
really the property of the Church, if she had her rights.
</p>

<p>
There are those who consider that Algeria ought to belong to the Arabs, that
Africa belongs to the blacks, and India to the Hindoos. Sat there comes this
awkward item of possession. You have to buy the man in possession out, or else
pitch him out; and the difficulty in this case was that there were so many in
possession. Eight companies and a Corporation are not easily ejected.
</p>

<p>
The fact was, the grand family council was a farce, and fell through. Even as a
demonstration it completely failed. The members of it might just as well have
stayed at home, and sent a monster petition to the House of Lords, several
hundred yards long (as per the usual custom now-a-days), and their progress
would have been about as great.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Stirmingham Daily News</i>, which had published the life of Sternhold
Baskette, and defended his legitimate line, poured bitter satire upon it, and
held the whole business up to ridicule—as well it might. The <i>News</i>
was now Conservative. The intense self-conceit of the Yankees—to imagine
that they were going to quietly take possession of a great English city, and
hoist the Stars and Stripes on Saint George’s Cathedral at Stirmingham!
</p>

<p>
The American gentlemen fumed and fussed, and uttered threats of making the
Stirmingham claim a feature in the next Presidential election—it should
“leave the low sphere of personal contention, and enter the arena of
political discussion;” so they said. It should be a new <i>Alabama</i>
case; and if they could not have Stirmingham, they would have—the
Dollars!
</p>

<p>
Meantime the dollars disappeared rather rapidly, and, after a month or six
weeks of these endless wranglings in the Sternhold Hall, there began to be
symptoms of an early break-up. First, three or four, then ten, then a dozen,
crept off, and quietly sailed for New York, lighter in pocket, and looking
rather foolish. The body, however, of the claimants could not break up in that
ignominious manner. It was necessary for them to do something to mark the fact
that they had been there, at all events.
</p>

<p>
The final result was that they appointed a committee of solicitors—one
for each section that chose to be represented. Twenty-two sections did choose,
and twenty-two solicitors formed the English committee who were to promote the
claims of one hundred and fifty able-bodied Baskettes and Sibboldians, who
represented about three times that number of women and children. Then they held
a banquet in the Sternhold Hall, and invited the Mayor of Stirmingham, who,
however, was very busy that evening, and “deeply regretted” his
inability to be present. The council then broke up, and departed for New York.
</p>

<p>
Aymer was indeed glad; now he should be able to see Violet again, and resume
his book so long laid aside. But no; there came a new surprise. A certain
recalcitrant borough in the West returned unexpectedly a member of the wrong
colour to Parliament, and the House was dissolved, and writs were issued for a
general election. Three days afterwards an address appeared in the
<i>Stirmingham Daily News</i>, announcing Marese Baskette as a candidate for
that place in the Conservative interest. The heir had resolved to enter the
House if possible, and his proclamation fell on Stirmingham, not like a
thunderbolt, but like the very apple of discord dropped from heaven.
</p>

<p>
First, it upset poor Aymer’s little plans and hopes. The companies were
desperately alarmed, and not without reason; for if Marese got into Parliament
he would, no doubt, very quickly become in himself a power, and would be
supported by his party in his claim upon the building societies. It would be to
the interest of his party that he should obtain his property—it would be
so much substantial gain to them. Practically, Marese Baskette would have the
important borough of Stirmingham in his pocket; therefore the party would be
sure to do all they could to get his claim fully admitted. Imagine that party
in power; fancy the chief at the head of Government!
</p>

<p>
Every one knows that justice and equity are immaculate in England, and that no
strain is ever put upon them for political purposes, or to gratify political
supporters. The fact is so well understood, so patent, that it is unnecessary
to adduce any proof of it. But there is, nevertheless, a certain indefinite
feeling that the complexion of the political party in power extends very
widely, and penetrates into quarters supposed to be remote from its centre.
Whichever happens to be uppermost—but let us not even think such
treasonable things.
</p>

<p>
At all events the companies had a real dread—a heartfelt fear—lest
Marese Baskette should get into Parliament, and so obtain political support to
his claim. They had foreseen something of the kind; they had dreaded its
happening any time ever since he came of age; but they had reckoned that his
known poverty would keep him out, especially as there was a very popular
landlord in the county, Sir Jasper Norton, who, with another prominent
supporter of the Liberal Government, had hitherto proved invincible. It had
hung over their heads for years; now it had fallen, and fallen, of all other
times, just at the very moment when their leases were on the point of expiring.
A more unfortunate moment for them could not have been chosen. With one consent
they resolved to fight him tooth and nail. This was fatal to poor Aymer’s
hopes. For the company (Number 6) which employed Shaw, Shaw, and Simson could
not possibly spare Mr Broughton’s energetic spirit; he must help them
fight the coming man. Broughton, seeing good fees and some sport, resolved, to
stay, and with him poor Aymer had to remain.
</p>

<p>
The whole city was in a ferment. Marese Baskette’s name was upon every
lip, and as the murmur swelled into a roar it grew into something very like a
cheer for the heir. That cheer penetrated the thick walls of many a fashionable
villa and mansion, and was listened to with ill-concealed anxiety. Many a
portly gentleman, dressed in the tailor’s best, with broad shirt-front,
gold studs, and heavy ring, rubicund with good living, as he stood upon his
hearth-rug, with his back to the fire, in the midst of his family circle,
surrounded with luxury, grew thoughtful and absent as that dull distant roar
reached his ears. Banker and speculator, city man, merchant, ironworker,
coalowner, millowner, heard and trembled. For the first time they began to
comprehend the meaning of the word Mob.
</p>

<p>
That word is well understood in America; twice it has been thoroughly spelt and
learnt by heart in France. Will it ever be learnt in England? Outside those
thick walls and strong shutters in the dingy street or dimly-lit suburban road,
where the bitter winter wind drove the cold rain and sleet along, there roamed
abroad a mighty monster roused from his den. They heard and trembled. Before
that monster the safeguards of civilisation are as cobwebs. He may be scotched
with Horse Guards and Snider rifles, beaten back into his caverns; but of what
avail is that after the mischief is done? In sober earnest, the middle classes
began to fear for the safety of Stirmingham. You see, the grey sewer-rats had
undermined it from end to end!
</p>

<p>
It happened that the ironmasters and the coalowners, and some of the
millowners, had held out long and successfully against a mighty strike: a
strike that extended almost to a million of hearths and homes. They had won in
the struggle, but the mind of the monster was bitter against them. They were
Liberal—nearly all. Let them and their candidates keep a good look-out!
</p>

<p>
It happened also that the winter was hard and cold, work scarce, provisions
dear; everything was wrong. It is at such times that, in exact opposition to
all rules, the grey rat flourishes!
</p>

<p>
Finally, it happened that the party who had so strangely abdicated power just
at the time when they seemed so firmly fixed, had committed a singularly, an
exceptionally, unpopular act. They had robbed the poor man of his beer! They
had curtailed his hours for drinking it, and to all appearance in an arbitrary
way. Rumour said that they contemplated an alliance with the Cold Water
Pump—that horror of horrors, the Temperance party. They had robbed the
poor man of his beer! And the grey rat showed his teeth.
</p>

<p>
Marese Baskette issued his <i>pronunciamento</i>, and at once opened the
campaign. Everybody read it, from the club-house to the grimy bar of the lowest
public-house. The club-house smiled, and said, “Clever;” the
pot-house cheered, and cried, “He’s our man.” He <i>was</i>
their man. Even yet, at this distance of time, there lingered in the minds of
the populace a distinct recollection of the great saturnalia which had been
held in the days of old Sternhold Baskette, when their candidate was born.
</p>

<p>
History magnifies itself as time rolls on; the memory of that brief hour of
unlimited riot had grown till it remained the one green spot in the life of the
Stirmingham populace. This was the very man—this was the very infant
whose advent, almost a generation ago, had been celebrated with rejoicings such
as no king or queen in these degenerate days ever offered to the people.
</p>

<p>
When old Sternhold Baskette in the joy of his heart poured out wine in gallons,
spirits in casks, and beer in rivers, he baptised his son Marese, the Child of
the People. And it bore fruit at this great distance of time.
</p>

<p>
John Marese Baskette was, as we know, a clever man; he had a still more subtle
man at his elbow. Between them they composed his address and his first oration.
Be sure they did not forget the memory so dear to the people. Not one single
thing was omitted which could tend to identify Marese Baskette with the
populace. The combination of capital against them, the hard winter and price of
provisions, all were skilfully turned to advantage; and, above all, the beer.
When the publicans had read his address they one and all said,
“He’s our man.” Licensed victuallers, beer-house keepers,
“off the premises” men, gin-palace, eating-house, restaurant,
hotel—all joined hands and marched in chorus, praising the man who
promised to turn on the beer.
</p>

<p class="poem">
For he’s a jolly good fellow,<br />
And so say all of us!
</p>

<p>
But Marese Baskette did not wholly rely upon the poorer classes: he gained the
goodwill, or at least the neutrality, of two-thirds of the middle classes, by
openly declaring that when he came into his property, as he grandly designated
half the city, he should devote one-third of it to the relief of local
taxation, to form a kind of common fund for sewers, gas, water, poor-rates,
paving, etc. He went further—this he did not promulgate openly, but he
caused it to be spread industriously abroad from house to house—and said
that, when he inherited his rights, the house rents should be reduced from
their present exorbitant figure.
</p>

<p>
Now it was notorious that the companies only waited to see whether they could
tide over the year of expiration of their leases before they raised the rents.
The arrow therefore went home. Baskette had hit the nail upon the head. The
other party began to threaten petitions for bribery—contending that these
promises were nothing short of it.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Daily Post</i> published a leader on “Glaring Corruption and
Wholesale Venality.” Baskette and Theodore smiled. What would be the use
of unseating him if, as they clearly saw, the opposite party was gone to utter
destruction?
</p>

<p>
Baskette met with a triumphant reception at his first meeting. Whenever he
appeared in the streets he was cheered to the echo.
</p>

<p>
The building societies and the Corporation were desperately alarmed. Though so
bitterly opposed to each other at ordinary times, a common fear gave them
unity. They held a secret meeting—at least they thought it was secret,
but such things are impossible in our time. The pen is everywhere—its
sharp point penetrates through the thickest wall. They united, formed
themselves into an association, voted funds—secret also—hired
speakers and hired roughs.
</p>

<p>
It all leaked out. The <i>Stirmingham Daily News</i>—Baskette’s
paper—came out with a report and a leader, and held up the poor heir to
the commiseration of the people. See what a combination against
him!—anything to keep him out of his rights. Hired speakers to talk him
down—hired roughs to knock him on the head. Vested interests arrayed
against him—poor heir! How deeply to be pitied! How greatly to be
sympathised with! The paper used stronger language than this, and hinted at
“gangs of foul conspirators,” but that was not gentlemanly.
</p>

<p>
The exposure was worth a thousand votes to Baskette. But though exposed, the
Corporation and the companies never ceased their efforts. Between them they
comprised almost all of the rich employers of labour. They had one terrible
engine—a fearful instrument of oppression and torture—invented in
our modern days, in order that we may not get free and “become as
gods.” They put on the screw.
</p>

<p>
There is not a working man in England, from the hedger and ditcher, and the
wretch who breaks the flints by the roadside, up to the best paid clerk or
manager of a bank—not one single man who receives wages from
another—who does not know the meaning of that word.
</p>

<p>
Let no one imagine that the “screw” is confined in its operation to
the needy artisan or the labourer. It extends into all ranks of society,
poisons every family circle, tortures every tenant and householder—all
who in any way depend for comfort, luxury, or peace upon another person. There
is but one rank who are free—the few who, whether for wages or as
tenants, never have to look to others.
</p>

<p>
Society is divided into two sections—the first, infinitely numerous, and
the second, infinitely few—i.e., the Screwed-down, and the Screw-drivers.
Now, the Corporation and the companies were the screw-drivers, and they twisted
the horrible engine up tight.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps they gave it one turn too many; at all events the mob set up a yell.
They formed processions and marched about the streets with bundles of screws,
strung like bunches of keys, at the end of poles. Squibs flew in all
directions—too personal to be quoted here. Somebody wrote a parody on
“John Brown’s Knapsack”—representing old Sternhold
Baskette as John Brown, and his soul as marching on. This, set to music,
resounded in every corner.
</p>

<p>
It is sad, but it is true. Everything might still have gone off pretty quiet,
had it not been for religion, or rather pseudo-religion. There were in the city
vast numbers of workmen of the lowest class from Ireland, and when the
watchwords “Orangemen” and “Papists” are mentioned,
every one will understand. Fights occurred hourly—a grand battle-royal
was imminent. The grey rats did all they could to foster the animosity, and got
up sham quarrels to set fire to the excited passions of the mob. Their game was
riot, in order that they might plunder. While the fools were fighting and the
wise men trying to put them down, the grey rats meant to make off with all they
could get.
</p>

<p>
Aymer, having by this time made for himself some little reputation for
intelligence and quick observation, was sent out by the committee, of which
Broughton was chairman, to watch the temper of the people; to penetrate into
all the corners and out-of-the-way places; to hang on the skirts of the crowd
and pick up their hopes and wishes, and to make reports from time to time as
anything struck him. He was even to bring in the lampoons and squibs that were
circulated, and, if possible, to spy out the secret doings of the other
party—a commission which gave him liberty to roam. He wished to be gone,
but this was better than the close office-work. He should see something of
life; he should see man face to face. (In gilded salons and well-bred society
it is only the profile one sees—the full face is averted.) He put on his
roughest suit, took his note-book, and strolled out into the city.
</p>

<p>
The first thing he had to report was that an insinuation which had been spread
abroad against Baskette was actually working in his favour. It had been thrown
out that he was upon too familiar terms with a certain lady, singer and
actress, the fame of whose wonderful beauty was sullied with suspicions of her
frailty. With a certain section of the people, who prided themselves upon being
“English to the backbone,” this was resented as unfair. With a far
larger portion it was at once believed, and, amid sly nods and winks, taken as
another proof that Baskette was one of themselves.
</p>

<p>
Aymer wandered about the city; he saw its horrors, its crime. At such a period
the sin, the wickedness and misery which commonly lurks in corners, came out
and flaunted in the daylight. A great horror fell upon him—a horror of
the drunkenness, the cursing, the immorality, the fierce brutishness. He
shuddered. Not that he was himself pure, but he was sensitive and quick to
understand, to see beneath the surface. He was of an age when the mind deals
with broad generalities. If this was the state of one city only—then,
poor England!
</p>

<p>
His imagination pictured a time when this monster might be uppermost. One night
he ascended the tower of a great brewery and looked down upon the city, all
flaring with gas. Up from the depth came the shouting, the hum of thousands,
the tramp of the multitudes. He looked afar. The horizon was bright with
blazing fires—the sky red with a crimson and yellow glow. Not a star, was
visible, a dense cloud of smoke hid everything. The iron furnaces shot forth
their glowing flames, the engines puffed and snorted. He thought of Violet and
trembled: when the monster was let loose, what then?
</p>

<p>
He descended and wandered away he knew not exactly whither, but he found
himself towards midnight mixed in a crowd around the police station. Jammed in
amid, the throng he was shoved against the wall, but fortunately a lamp-post
preserved him from the crush. However, he could not move. The gas-light fell
upon the wall and lit up the proclamations of “V.R.”—the
advertisements of missing and lost, the descriptions of persons who were
wanted, etc.
</p>

<p>
One sheet, half-defaced with the wind and rain and mud splashed against it,
caught his eye—
</p>

<p>
“Escaped,” so ran the fragment, “from... mingham Asylum, a
lunatic of homicidal tendencies... Stabbed a warder... killed his wife by
driving a nail into her head... Is at large. His description—Long grey
hair, restless eye, peculiar ears, walks with a shambling gait, and has a
melancholy expression of countenance. Plays fantastic airs upon a tin whistle,
and is particularly fond of tinkering.”
</p>

<p>
A new bill, “Two Hundred Pounds Reward,” for the apprehension of a
defaulting bank manager, blotted out the rest.
</p>

<p>
But Aymer had read enough. A sickening sensation seized him—this horrible
being loose upon society, tinkering, playing upon a tin whistle, and driving
nails into women’s heads! In his ears sounded the din of tremendous
shouts, “Baskette for ever!” and he saw a carriage go by from which
the horses had been taken, and in which a man was standing upright, with his
hat off, bowing. It was Marese Baskette returning from an evening meeting, and
dragged in his carriage by the mob to his hotel.
</p>

<p>
Aymer caught a glance of his dark eye flashing with triumph, and it left an
unpleasant impression upon him. But the shouts rose up to the thick cloud of
smoke overhead—“Baskette for ever! Baskette for ever!”
</p>

<p>
“Oh! my love,” wrote Aymer to Violet, “this is, indeed, an
awful place. I begin to live in dread of my fellow-creatures. Not for
worlds—no, not for worlds, would I be the owner of this city (as so many
are striving to be), lest I should be held, partly at least, responsible
hereafter for its miseries, its crimes, its drunkenness, its nameless,
indefinable horrors.”
</p>

<p>
These words, read by what afterwards happened, are remarkable. Aymer’s
last vision of Stirmingham was the same man drawn again in his carriage amid
tenfold louder shouts than before, “Baskette for ever!” He headed
the poll by over 1000 votes.

The grey rats were triumphant.

<h2>Book III.—Results.</h2>





<h3>One.</h3>

<p>
After a life in which each day was spent in happy anticipation of the pleasures
of the next, the calm, quiet existence at The Towers would have been dull and
cheerless to Violet. But following so soon upon the death of Waldron, under
such awful circumstances, the life with Lady Lechester seemed to her, for a
while at least, like that in a haven of refuge where the storm without could
not reach. And had Aymer been there, or near at hand, she would in a quiet way
have been happy.
</p>

<p>
For Lady Lechester was singularly kind. She made no show of sympathy, she did
not ask, as some pretentiously hospitable people do every morning, if she were
comfortable and had all she wished. But Agnes possessed a rare and delicate
tact, the power of perceiving what others felt, of anticipating their smallest
fancies.
</p>

<p>
She accommodated herself and her habits to Violet, and there grew up between
them a firm friendship, and more than that—a companionship. Agnes kept no
secret from Violet. Violet had none to hide from her.
</p>

<p>
There was one topic only which Violet never of her own volition approached, but
she was perfectly aware that something of the kind was going on. In an
indefinable manner she had learnt that Agnes had a suitor. It came to her
knowledge that he was extremely wealthy, but low born in comparison with her
long descent. How Agnes looked upon him it was hard to say. She was fully
five-and-thirty, and that is an age at which women begin to feel that now, if
ever, is the time when they must choose a companion.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand it is an age when the glamour of early hope and youthful
fancy, are hardly likely to gild the first figure that approaches with a beauty
not really its own. It is an age when the mind can choose calmly and
deliberately, in the true sense of the word. Violet had never seen this man, or
heard his name, but she knew that there was correspondence between them, for
she had seen the letters with a foreign postmark. She gathered that he was in
America. After which Agnes whispered that he would shortly be home, and would
visit her.
</p>

<p>
“He is very handsome,” she said, for the first time speaking
directly upon the subject. “He is a man who could not be passed in a
crowd, even were it not for exceptional circumstances surrounding him. And yet.
I do not know—I do not know.”
</p>

<p>
Then she was silent again for several days, but presently approached the
inevitable topic again.
</p>

<p>
Would it be possible for a woman to really banish that topic from her mind?
Agnes could the more easily confide in Violet, because she was fully aware of
her love for Aymer. It is easier to speak to those who have had similar
experiences, than to those who are as yet ignorant.
</p>

<p>
“He is in England, now,” said Agnes, one day. “He is not far
distant. Why should I conceal it any longer? Your friend Mr Malet meets him
daily, I daresay; he is a candidate for Stirmingham. It is Mr Marese
Baskette.”
</p>

<p>
“I must congratulate you,” said Violet. “He is the richest
man in the world, is he not?”
</p>

<p>
“He will be if he succeeds in obtaining his rights. To tell you the
truth, I think the great battle he is fighting with these companies and
claimants, gives me more interest in him than—than—well, I
don’t know. You will see him soon. He will come directly the election is
over. Now you know why I took so much interest in your letters from Mr Malet,
describing the course of the family council. But I think he is wrong, dear, in
the last that you showed me. I think I should like to be the owner of that
great city—it is true there would be responsibilities, but then there
would be opportunities, he forgets that. Think what one could do—the
misery to be alleviated, the crime to be hunted out, the great work that would
be possible.”
</p>

<p>
Her eyes flashed, her form dilated. It was easy to see that to the ambition
innate in her nature, the idea of having an immense city to reign over, as it
were, like the princesses of old, was almost irresistible. A true, good woman
she was, but it would have been impossible for her not to have been ambitions.
</p>

<p>
“With <i>his</i> talent,” she said—becoming freer upon the
subject the longer she dwelt upon it—“with <i>his</i> talent, for
he is undoubtedly a clever man, with the love the populace there have for him,
with my long descent—perhaps the longest in the county—which
enables me to claim kindred with powerful families, with a seat in Parliament,
there seems no reasonable limit to what we might not do. That is the way to put
it. You shall see his letters.”
</p>

<p>
Violet read them. Marese Baskette was gifted with the power of detecting the
points which pleased those he conversed or corresponded with, and upon these he
dwelt and dilated. It was this that made his speeches so successful in
Stirmingham. As he spoke he noted those passages and allusions which awoke the
enthusiasm of the audience. Next time he omitted those sentiments which had
failed to attract attention, and confined himself to those which were
applauded. In half a dozen trials he produced a speech, every word of which was
cheered to the echo.
</p>

<p>
So, in his intercourse with Agnes Lechester, the same faculty of perceiving
what pleased, led him to disregard the ordinary method of lovers; he avoided
all mention, or almost avoided, expressions of affection, or of love, and
harped upon the string which he had found vibrated most willingly in her
breast. The theme was ample and he did not hesitate to work upon it. He
compared his position and that of Agnes when united, and when his rights were
conceded, to that of the royal reigning dukes of Italy a hundred years
ago—dukes whose territory in area was not large, but whose power within
that area was absolute.
</p>

<p>
The city of Stirmingham was in effect a grander possession than Parma or Milan;
far more valuable estimated in coin, far more influential estimated by the
extent of its commerce. Without a doubt, when once he had obtained possession,
the Government would soon recognise his claims and confer upon him a coronet,
unless indeed Agnes preferred a career of perhaps greater power in the House of
Commons. He candidly admitted his ignoble descent.
</p>

<p>
“My ancestor,” he wrote, “was a poor basket-maker; there is
no attempt on my part to conceal the fact. I am perfectly well aware that upon
the score of blood I am far, far, your inferior, and unable to offer a single
claim to equality. The Lechesters, I know, were powerful auxiliaries of
William, the Conqueror of England. The name is preserved in the Roll of Battle
Abbey; it occupies an important place in the ‘early chronicles.’
Heralds have blazoned its arms, genealogists recorded its descent, poets have
sung its fame. Yet remember, even in this view of the matter, that the great
William himself, the feudal lord of the Lechesters, was descended upon the
mother’s side from a tanner. I cannot compare my father, grand old
Sternhold, with William the Conqueror; and yet, in this age when wealth is what
provinces and conquered countries used to be, perhaps there may be some faint
resemblance.”
</p>

<p>
Then he went on:—“I will not disguise from you the fact that in
your long descent, and in your connections with the highest families in the
land—not even excepting ancient royalty—I place much of my hope for
recovering my legitimate possessions and for fighting my myriad enemies. To me
the alliance is simply invaluable. To yourself I would fain hope it would not
be without its charms. I do not approach you with a boy’s silly affection
expressed in rhyme and love-sick glances. I do not follow your footsteps from
place to place. It is long since I have had even ten minutes conversation with
you. I have treated you as I should an equal (not in position, for there you
are superior), but as my equal in mind and ability; not as your sex is commonly
treated. I have not wooed you as a woman. I have asked you to be my partner,
something more than my partner in the kingdom—for so in fact it
is—which is mine by right.”
</p>

<p>
This tone was exactly fitted to the mind of the person he addressed. Delicate
and full of benevolence, kind, thoughtful, anxious always for others good,
there was still at the root of Agnes Lechester’s mind a strong vaulting
ambition. An ambition which some said had warped her mind with overweening
pride, which had cut her off from the natural sphere in which she should have
moved, leaving her with little or no society, and which, if rumour spoke
correctly, had in earlier days forced her to stifle the heart that beat
responsive to another’s love.
</p>

<p>
To Violet, this calm, reasoning courtship, full of coronets and crowns,
thinking of nothing but power, was inexplicable. Her heart wrapped up in Aymer,
she could not understand this species of barter—of long descent and good
family against wealth and property. It seemed unnatural—almost a kind of
sacrilege. She fancied that Agnes was not without twinges of conscience, not
without hesitation, and naturally put down her apparent vacillation to
feelings, similar to those which would have animated herself under the same
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
This is not the place to argue upon marriage; but in passing it does appear
that both sides are right and both wrong. It does not of necessity follow that
marriage must be for love only; but on the other hand it does not follow that
marriage should be for convenience always, and never for affection. In the
present instance, to all appearance the parties were exactly fitted to each
other. It was notorious that although Lady Lechester had a sufficient income
for all her purposes, and even a superfluity, that the revenue from her large
estates was greatly reduced by encumbrances upon it. There were surmises that
this comparatively inadequate income was one reason why Agnes saw so little
society; she was too proud to mingle in a circle for which her purse was
unfitted.
</p>

<p>
Marese, the moment he had an opportunity, did not lose this chance either. In a
letter, which Violet was permitted to read, he gradually and by degrees
approached the subject of the mortgages and other encumbrances upon the
Lechester estates. Instead of being an obstacle, this very fact, he argued, was
one reason why their union was singularly appropriate. At the same moment that
her family and connections gave him a position for which otherwise he might
have striven in vain, his wealth (Marese always kept up the belief in others
that he was, even at present, extremely wealthy) would free those ancient
estates, and restore them to their pristine splendour.
</p>

<p>
Then came a brief telegram, announcing that he had won the representation of
Stirmingham by a majority of 1000 votes. Agnes was visibly elated. She moved
with a prouder step—there was a slight flush upon her usually pale cheek.
It was a proof of his genius—of that godlike genius which commands men.
He possessed the same qualities which in the ages past had made the Lechesters
members of the ruling race.
</p>

<p>
Violet saw that the balance bowed in his favour. If he were to come
now—and he did come.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely three days after the election, Marese drove up to The Towers, and was
received with a stately courtesy—a proud indifference which bewildered
Violet. She knew, or thought she knew, that Agnes’s heart was beating
with excitement—yet how calm, how distant and formal she appeared.
</p>

<p>
Violet looked with interest upon Marese, having heard so much of him from Aymer
and Agnes.
</p>

<p>
On his part, meeting her attentive gaze and hearing her name, Marese slightly
started, recovered himself, and bowed profoundly. His attention was wholly
bestowed upon Lechester; the conversation between them seemed to Violet
constrained and cold to the last degree. She could not help acknowledging that
Marese was a handsome man—far handsomer in features and figure than was
Aymer. But how different! In her heart of hearts she pitied poor Agnes if such
was her choice.
</p>

<p>
They betrayed no desire whatever to be alone; on the contrary, Agnes
particularly desired Violet to remain in the apartment with them. Their talk
was of distant things, till it travelled round to the scene of Marese’s
candidature, and finally fixed itself upon the great case. Marese was extremely
sanguine in his language, and indeed he was so in reality. He had gained two
important steps he said. In the first place he had partly paid off the claims
of the companies for expenses incurred during their tenure of the leases, on
the pretence of improving the estate. These expenses reached a preposterous
figure; he had succeeded in getting them taxed and considerably reduced, and he
had also succeeded in obtaining an order from the Court of Chancery that the
payment of these claims should be made by instalments. He casually mentioned
that the first instalment of 100,000 pounds had been paid yesterday. The second
step was his admittance to Parliament, which, properly worked, would enable him
to obtain the support of the party now in power.
</p>

<p>
Still further, the great family council had blown over without result. The
mountain had been in labour, and a mouse had sprung forth. That spectre which
had hovered over the city of Stirmingham so long—the spectre of the
American claims—had at last put in its appearance, and was found to be
hollow and unsubstantial. He did not think there was anything more to be
dreaded from that spectral host. The building societies even, despaired of
being able to prolong the contest by supporting the American claims. They could
no longer refuse to give up possession on the ground that they did not know who
was the true heir. It could not be denied who was the heir.
</p>

<p>
Marese stayed but one afternoon. He was too wise to make himself common. Before
he went he formally asked for a private interview. What passed Violet easily
gathered from what Agnes said to her afterwards.
</p>

<p>
“Mr Broughton will be here in a day or two,” she said; “tell
Mr Malet to come with him. The mortgages I have told you of are to be paid off;
Broughton will manage it.”
</p>

<p>
From which it was evident that a definite understanding had been come to with
Marese. Agnes was silent and thoughtful all the evening. Towards the hour when
they usually retired, she called Violet to the window, and put her arm round
her neck.
</p>

<p>
“Suppose,” she said, “all the meadows and hills you see out
there were yours, and had been your ancestors for so many
centuries—remember, too, that we may die however well we
feel—should you like to think that the estate would then fall into the
helpless hands of one of two lunatics?”
</p>

<p>
It was clear that the natural hope of children to inherit had influenced her.
Violet had heard something of the lunacy inherent in certain branches of the
Lechester family:
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Two.</h3>

<p>
The manner in which Marese Baskette became acquainted with Lady Lechester
affords another instance of those “circumstances over which we have no
control,” which have already been so strongly illustrated in this
history. In the course of his purchases of land and property, old Sternhold
Baskette was so shrewd and far-seeing, and so difficult to impose upon, that
only once did he make any considerable mistake.
</p>

<p>
It happened that among other land which he bought at no great distance from
Stirmingham, there was a small plot of not much more than two acres, which was
included in a large area, and not specified particularly in the agreement. This
plot had been in the hands of tenants who had lived so long upon it that they
believed they had acquired a prescriptive right. They sold their right to a
person whom we may call A, and A sold it in common with other property to
Sternhold Baskette. The thing was done, no questions asked, and apparently no
one thought anything more about it. But what piece of land is there so small
that it can escape the eagle eye of an English lawyer? And especially when that
lawyer is a new broom, and a rising man determined to make his mark.
</p>

<p>
So it happened that Mr Broughton, Lady Lechester’s new solicitor (and
successor to his uncle’s practice), in going over the map of the estate,
and comparing it with older maps, found out that there was a certain two-acre
piece missing; and being anxious to recommend himself to so good a client as
Lady Agnes, lost no time in tracing out the clue to it.
</p>

<p>
He had not much difficulty in discovering the facts of the case, but it was
very soon apparent to his legal knowledge that although the documentary claim
of Lady Agnes, and her moral right, were indisputable, yet the whole value of
the little property would probably be swallowed up in costs, if an attempt was
made to recover it. He represented the fact to her, but Lady Agnes at once
instructed him to proceed.
</p>

<p>
The same over-mastering pride which was the one fault of her character, lent an
almost sacred value to every piece of land, however small, which had once
formed part of the estate of her ancestors. Not one rood of ground would she
have parted with, not one perch should remain in the hands of strangers whilst
she had the means of disputing possession. Yet this was the very woman who,
with open-handed generosity, was ever ready to succour or assist the poor, and
would not hesitate to spend large sums of money to give another person a
pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Mr Broughton went to law and quickly found it a tough job, for this was one of
those small properties which old Sternhold had been able to keep in his own
hands, and his son Marese was not disposed to part with it, especially as with
lapse of time—although situated far from the city proper—it had
increased in value some twenty-five per cent.
</p>

<p>
Broughton advised Lady Agnes not to go to the inevitable expense of protracted
litigation; but she was firm, and the battle began in the Courts, when
suddenly, as the forces advanced to the fight, the enemy gave in and
surrendered without firing a shot.
</p>

<p>
It was a piece of Theodore’s work. That subtle brain of his had perceived
a means by which Marese might, if he played his cards rightly, obtain the value
of this little plot of land ten times over. Why not marry this Lady Lechester?
She would give him exactly what he wanted—a position and connections
among the nobility which all the wealth of old Sternhold could not buy.
</p>

<p>
“Who is Lady Lechester?” asked Marese.
</p>

<p>
Theodore told him. He knew, because in the asylum at Stirmingham there were two
lunatics of that family, the most profitable of the patients the asylum
contained.
</p>

<p>
“If any accident should happen to either of those patients,” said
Theodore, “Lady Lechester’s property would be doubled; if an
accident happen to both of them, it would be trebled. Accidents sometimes
happen in the best regulated asylums. The easiest way to get rid of a lunatic
who exhibits homicidal tendencies is—to let him escape. He kills two or
three, and then—he cuts his own throat. With a lunatic who has not got
homicidal tendencies, and whose madness is, between ourselves, a <i>matter of
opinion</i>—with such persons there are other methods; but no matter, get
Lady Lechester first.” And Marese, seeing that his (Theodore’s)
words were good, did as he was advised.
</p>

<p>
One day there called at The Towers a gentleman, who was received by Lady Agnes
in the most distant manner, for she recognised his name as that of her
opponent. Marese met her with a species of mingled deference and pride, exactly
suited to the person he addressed. He begged pardon for his intrusion; he felt
that an apology was due to Lady Lechester which written words could not convey.
His lawyers had involved him in a mistaken and ungentlemanly contest. When he
had learnt that his antagonist was a lady, and a lady of distinguished
position, he had looked into the matter personally, and at once saw that
whatever claim the chicanery of the law gave him, was far over-balanced by the
moral and social right of Lady Lechester. He had at once stayed proceedings,
had ordered his solicitors to immediately restore possession to Lady Lechester,
and had come in person to offer his sincere apology for the trouble he had
inadvertently caused.
</p>

<p>
Be sure that Marese’s personal appearance had something to do with his
success. At all events Lady Agnes was deeply impressed with his conduct, which
she easily ascribed to a nobility of mind; and not to be outdone, while she
freely accepted the land, she insisted upon disbursing a sum sufficient to
cover the money that had been spent on it.
</p>

<p>
From that hour Marese was a favoured visitor at The Towers. He came but rarely,
but when he came his presence lingered after him. His name, as the heir of
Stirmingham, was constantly before her in the papers and on everyone’s
lips. Add to this his own deep artifice, and it is not to be wondered at that
he made progress.
</p>

<p>
At last it came to pass that Broughton was engaged in arranging the clearing
off of certain heavy incumbrances upon the Lechester estate, with money which
Marese had received for salvage of the <i>Lucca</i>. Such an arrangement could
only mean marriage.
</p>

<p>
Not long after Marese’s visit to The Towers, Aymer arrived with
Broughton, bringing with him a collection of pictures, old Bibles, and some few
bronzes for Lady Lechester, and a heart full of affection for Violet. He was
invited to stay several days, and did so, and for that brief time the joys they
had shared at The Place seemed to return. The weather of early spring was too
chilly for much out-of-door exercise; but they had all the vast structure of
The Towers to wander over—galleries and corridors, vast rooms where they
were unlikely to be interrupted, for now the new wing had been built, very few
of the servants ever entered the old rooms, and Lady Agnes never. Aymer had
come with his mind full of a thousand things he had to say—of love, of
hope, of projects that he had formed, and yet when they were together, and the
silent rooms invited him to speak, he found himself instead listening to
Violet’s low voice as she told him all about her life at The Towers, and
her feelings for him. It was natural that, the first pleasures of their meeting
over, Violet should speak of Lady Agnes, and Aymer of the heir, with whose
fortunes he had of late seemed to be mixed up. Violet was full of a subject
which she had long wanted to confide to Aymer, and yet hardly liked to write.
It was about some singularities of Lady Agnes.
</p>

<p>
She was very kind, very affectionate and considerate, and yet, Violet said, it
seemed to those who lived with her constantly that she had something for ever
preying upon her mind. She was subject to fits of silence and abstraction,
which would seize her at unaccountable times, and she would then rise and
withdraw, and shut herself up in her own room for hours; and once for as long
an two days she remained thus secluded.
</p>

<p>
At such times she generally used a small room in the new wing, the key of which
never left her hands, and which no one entered but herself. Another singular
habit which she had was going out at night, or after dusk, into the most
unfrequented portion of the park. She would seem to be seized with a sudden
desire to escape all notice and observation, would put on her hat, wrap herself
in a plain shawl, and let the weather be what it might, go forth alone. The
servants were so well acquainted with this habit that they never offered to
accompany her—indeed, it was part of the household etiquette to affect
not to notice her at these times. Her absence rarely exceeded an hour, but
knowing that poachers were often abroad, Violet owned that these nocturnal
rambles filled her with alarm while they lasted. Another peculiar thing was
that Lady Agnes seemed at times as if she believed there was a third person in
the room, invisible to others. Once, Violet going into her apartment, surprised
her talking in an excited tone, and found to her astonishment that there was no
one near her. She was about to retire, when she was transfixed with
astonishment to see that Agnes held a naked sword in her hand, which she would
point at some invisible object, and then speak softly in a tongue that Violet
did not understand, but believed to be Latin. Violet saw that she was not
perceived. Agnes’ eyes were wide open, but fixed and staring, as if she
saw and yet did not see. Afraid, and yet unwilling to call assistance, Violet
remained in the ante-chamber, and presently there was a profound silence. She
cautiously went in and found the sword returned to its position over the
mantelpiece, and Lady Agnes fast asleep in her armchair.
</p>

<p>
What ought she to do? Ought the family physician, Dr Parker, to be made
acquainted with these facts, or was it best to pass them unnoticed? Violet was
half afraid to say so, but at these times an ill-defined dread would arise lest
Agnes’ mind was partly affected. Insanity was well known to run in the
Lechester family. Violet’s gentle and affectionate mind was filled with
fear lest her benefactress should suffer some injury. What had she better do?
</p>

<p>
It was a difficult question, and Aymer could not answer it. To him, Lady
Lechester appeared to be of perfectly sound mind; he could hardly believe the
strange things Violet had told him. At all events it would be best not to take
any action at present; better wait and watch if these symptoms developed
themselves. Violet should keep as close a watch upon Lady Agnes as was
compatible with not arousing her suspicions, and yet—
</p>

<p>
The selfishness of the true lover came to the surface. He did not like to leave
his love in a house where the mistress was certainly given to odd habits, and
might possibly be really insane—not even though that mistress had shown
the most disinterested and affectionate interest in her. But what could he do?
His time was up, he must return to Broughton and recommence the old dreary
round of labour, to recommence the book he was writing in his solitary
apartments. The poor fellow was very miserable at parting, though Agnes asked
him to come when he chose.
</p>

<p>
Violet was less moved than her lover. The truth was she had an unlimited
confidence in Aymer’s genius, and believed it would triumph over every
obstacle.
</p>

<p>
It was very strange, but these symptoms she had described to Aymer, seemed to
increase and strengthen directly afterwards. Lady Lechester seemed to desire
more and more to be alone: she wandered more frequently out into the park, not
only by night but in the open daylight; and Violet watching her, and yet
ashamed to watch, learnt which way her steps tended, and was always prepared,
if any alarm was given, to start at once for the spot.
</p>

<p>
That spot was about half-a-mile, perhaps a little more, from The Towers, and
just within the park walls. It was concealed from The Towers by the intervening
trees which dotted the park, but there was no wood or copse to pass through in
reaching it.
</p>

<p>
Wherever a rapid river eats its way through a hilly country, and where streams
dash down from the hills to join it, there singular tunnels, or whatever the
proper name may be, are often found. The Ise (obviously a corruption of Ouse)
was a narrow, clear stream, extremely rapid, and confined between high banks,
which made it, for two-thirds of its career, practically inaccessible.
</p>

<p>
At this particular place, in days gone by, it appeared as if a stream, perhaps
flowing from some long extinct glacier, had cut its way down to the river by
boring a narrow, circular tunnel through the bank of the river. This tunnel was
narrow at the top, not larger than would admit the body of a man, but widened
as it descended, till where it reached the river there was a considerable cave,
and any one kneeling on the sward above could look down upon the water of the
river in the dim light, and hear its gurgling, murmuring sound rise up, greatly
increased in volume by the acoustic properties of the tunnel, which somewhat
resembled the famed Ear of Dionysius, though of course irregular in shape. When
the river was swollen with rain or snow, the water came halfway up the tunnel,
and the gurgling noise then rose into a hissing, bubbling sound, like that from
a huge cauldron of boiling water. Hence, perhaps, its popular name of
“Pot.” Such “Pots” are to be found, more or less varied
in construction, in many parts of England, and generally associated with some
local tradition of supernatural beings, or of ancient heroes.
</p>

<p>
This particular funnel was known as Kickwell Pot—an apparently unmeaning
name. The antiquaries, however, would have it that Kickwell was a degenerate
form of Cwichhelm, the name of a famous chieftain in the days when the Saxons
and Britons fought for the fairest isle of the sea. Probably, they added,
Cwichhelm, in one of his numerous battles, was defeated, and perhaps forced to
take refuge in this very cave, which was accessible in a canoe or small boat
from below, and may have been larger and more capable of habitation then than
in our time. At all events, Kickwell Pot had a bad name in the neighbourhood,
and there were traditions that more than one man had lost his life, by
attempting to descend its precipitous sides in search of treasure temptingly
displayed by a dwarf. This may or may not have been founded upon some old
worship of a water-spirit or cave-god. The effect was that the common people
shunned the spot.
</p>

<p>
It was a wild place. The beech trees and the great hawthorns, which half-filled
that side of the park, completely hid all view of the mansion, and on the right
and left were steep downs, so thinly clad with vegetation that the chalk was
bare in places. In front swirled along the dark river, whose bank rose twenty
feet almost sheer cliff, and opposite was a plantation of fir. On the left
hand, facing the fir plantation, was the low stone wall of the park which ended
here. Near the mouth of “The Pot,” round which some one had built
up a loosely-compacted wall of a few stones without mortar, to keep sheep from
falling in, was the trunk of a decayed oak tree, once vast in size and reaching
to a noble height, now a mere stump, but still retaining a certain weird
grandeur. Its hollow trunk formed a natural hut, facing “The Pot”
and the dark fir plantation.
</p>

<p>
This was a singular spot for the mistress of that fair estate to frequent
almost at all hours of the day and night. No wonder that Violet, having
ascertained its character, grew more and more alarmed, and kept a closer watch.
</p>

<h3>Three.</h3>

<p>
When even the most strictly logical mind looks round and investigates the
phenomena attending its own existence, perhaps the first fact to attract
attention by its strongly marked prominence, is the remarkable loneliness of
man. He stands alone. He may have brethren, but they are far below, and like
Joseph’s seen in the dream, must bow the knee to his state. There
extends, as it were, behind him a vast army of bird, beast, reptile, fish, and
insect, thronging the broad earth in countless myriads, whose ancestry goes
back into periods of time which cannot be expressed by notation. And every one
of these, from the tiniest insect to the majestic elephant, is man’s
intellectual inferior; so that he stands alone on a pedestal on the apex of a
huge pyramid of animal life. He looks back—there are millions of inferior
creatures. He looks forward—where is his superior? His mind easily grasps
the idea of a superior, but where is it? He cannot see, feel, touch, or in any
way indisputably prove the existence of a superior being, or race of beings.
Yet the mind within is so wonderful and so complex, that it <i>will</i> not
accept the conclusion that he really stands alone; that he is the completion
and the keystone of creation. A little thought convinces him of his own
shortcomings, tells him how far he is from perfection, and the analogy of all
things teaches him almost instinctively to look above into the Unknown for a
superior being, or a race of beings. It is contrary to all reason and logic, to
all analogy and all imagination, that there should be so many myriads behind,
and nothing in <i>front</i>. There must be beings in front of him in the scale
of existence, just as he is in front of the beings in his rear. Where are they?
</p>

<p>
The answer to that question has peopled the whole universe with invisible
beings. The solid earth beneath our feet has, according to one form of
mythology, its gnomes and dwarfs, low of stature, grimy of aspect, but mighty
in strength; or it has its Pluto and its Proserpine, its Titans struggling
under Etna. The air and the sky above us teem with such shapes; they follow us
night and day as our good and evil genii, or they engage in mighty
battles—Armageddons of the angels in the empyrean, echoes of whose
thundering charges reach our ears on earth.
</p>

<p>
Such a belief has existed from the earliest days; it has spread over the whole
world, it dwells in our midst at this very hour; for what is the so-called
spiritualism but a new development of the oldest of all creeds? Even the very
atheists, or those who deny the existence of a Supreme
Deity—all-creating, all-sustaining—even these admit that there is
no logical argument conclusively proving that there are not races of beings
superior to our imperfect bodies. Modern science goes a step farther, and all
but positively asserts that there are such creatures. It has long speculated as
to the possibility of life in some shape or another in the stars and suns of
the firmament. One grey-headed veteran, foremost in the ranks of the hardest of
all science (anatomy), gravely, and step by step, argues out and demonstrates
the fact, that all known living beings are developed, as it were, from one
archetypal skeleton. And he concludes with the remarkable statement that,
according to all laws of geometry (another hard science), this archetypal
skeleton is not exhausted yet; it is still capable of further modification, of
fresh development—nay, even that the strange beings with wings and wheels
seen by Ezekiel in his vision, are possibilities of the same skeleton. The
belief in itself is therefore not a matter for ridicule, however much we may
deplore some of the forms which it has taken.
</p>

<p>
Violet, watch how she might, never learnt the whole secret of Agnes
Lechester’s apparent vagaries. The genesis of an idea in the mind is
difficult to trace; but substantially the circumstances were these.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen years since, Lady Agnes Lechester was seen and loved by a certain
Walter de Warren, a cornet in a dragoon regiment: a lad of good family but
miserably poor. Agnes returned his affection: her heart responded to his love,
but her pride forbade a marriage. He was not only poor, but had no kind of
distinction: nothing whatever to mark him out from the common herd of men
except a handsome face and figure. Even then the innate pride of the Lechesters
was stirring in Agnes’s inner mind, and love as she might, nothing would
induce her to listen to him.
</p>

<p>
This disposition on her part was encouraged by the trustees of the estate, or
rather guardians, who, under pretence of keeping up the dignity of the family,
represented to her that such a union would be disgraceful. Let the young man
win his spurs, and then his poverty would be no obstacle in their sight. They
had an object in view in retarding the marriage of their ward. It was true that
no salary or commission was allowed for the management of the estate; but all
wise men know that there are ways and means of making a profit in an indirect
manner. Evil report said that more than one of the mortgages which encumbered
the property had been incurred, not from necessity, or from the consequences of
extravagance, but simply in order that these parties might receive a handsome
gratuity for the permission given to put out large sums at a safe interest.
</p>

<p>
De Warren was deeply affected when Agnes calmly told him her view of the
matter, admitted without reserve that she liked him—loved she could not
say, though that was the truth—but added that marriage or further
intercourse was impossible, so long as he remained unknown and unheard of among
men.
</p>

<p>
He kissed her hand, and swore to win distinction or to perish. He at once
exchanged or volunteered—I forget which, but I think the
latter—into a detachment going to China.
</p>

<p>
When once Agnes had received a letter, which had travelled with its message of
love and admiration over those thousands and thousands of miles of ocean, then
she realised how she had cut herself off from her own darling; and her heart,
before so cold and hard, softened, and was full of miserable forebodings. She
lost much of her youthful beauty—the incessant anxiety that gnawed at her
heart deprived her cheeks of their bloom, and her form of its graceful lines.
She grew pale, even haggard, and people whispered that the heiress was fast
going into a decline. Hours and hours she spent alone in the room of the old
mansion where the parting had taken place. Sitting there in the Blue Room, as
it was called, her mind filled with pictures of war and its dangers, her soul
ever strung up to the highest pitch of anxious waiting, what wonder was it that
Agnes began to see visions and to dream dreams—visions that she never
mentioned, dreams that she never told. It would be easy to argue that what
happened was a mere coincidence; that her fears had excited her mind; and that
if the actual event had not lent a factitious importance to the affair, it
would have passed as a mental delusion.
</p>

<p>
Certain it was that in May, about ten months after De Warren’s departure,
Agnes grew suddenly cheerful—the very opposite to what she had been. She
sang and played, and danced about the old house. She said that something had
told her that De Warren was coming home. No letter had reached her to that
effect; the war was still going on, and yet she was perfectly certain that for
some reason or other the cornet was returning—and, what was better, was
returning covered with honours. Those in the house looked upon this sudden
change of spirits and manner as a certain sign that something would happen to
the heiress, and her faithful old nurse (dead before Violet’s advent)
kept a close watch upon her.
</p>

<p>
One day, a curious thing happened. In the midst of lunch, Lady Agnes sprang up
from table with a joyful but hysterical laugh, and declared that Walter was
coming on horseback, and she must go and meet him. Quick as thought she had her
hat on, and rushed out of the house, the nurse following at a little distance,
anxious to see what would happen.
</p>

<p>
Lady Agnes walked swiftly across the park to a little wicket-gate in the wall,
where Warren used to meet her. Then she stopped and looked along the path,
while the nurse hid behind the trunk of a beech tree at a short distance. In a
few minutes Agnes cried out, “I hear him—I hear him; it is his
footstep.” Then a minute afterwards she flung out her arms as if
embracing some one, and cried, and seemed to kiss the air, uttering warm words
of affection. The nurse saw nothing—only a light puff of wind stirred the
leaves and caused a rustling.
</p>

<p>
Agnes in a few moments turned to the right, and began to walk, or rather glide,
as it seemed to the excited fancy of the nurse, at a swift pace, all the while
talking as if to some person who accompanied her, and every now and then
pausing to throw her arms round his neck, and uttering an hysterical sob. She
made straight for “The Pot,” and went quickly round the oak stump.
The nurse followed rapidly, and as she peeped round the oak there was Lady
Agnes facing her on the other side of “The Pot,” with both arms
extended and her face white as death. “Walter,” she said,
distinctly; “Walter, what does that red spot on your forehead mean? Are
you angry?” Then she fell prone on the grass in a dead faint, and the
nurse had immense trouble to get her home again.
</p>

<p>
Just a month afterwards came the news that Walter was dead, having been shot in
the <i>forehead</i> with a ball from a matchlock while leading on his men. He
had won much praise by his desperate courage, and the last despatch recommended
him for promotion, and for the Cross for saving life under heavy fire.
</p>

<p>
Now, looked at dispassionately by others, the whole incident resolves itself
into a case of excitement and over-anxiety acting upon a naturally sensitive
organisation. But it was easy to see how to Lady Agnes the affair wore a very
different light. To her the imaginary shape, invisible to others, which had met
her at the little wicket-gate, was real—the spirit of her lover, which
had come from the wilds of China, over thousands of miles, to acquaint her in
dumb show of the destruction of its body.
</p>

<p>
From that moment she became a devout believer in the power of the dead to
revisit their friends. She was not alarmed. On the contrary, the thought
soothed her. She expected and waited for Walter’s second approach, and
spoke lovingly when he came again. For he, or the unsubstantial vision in his
form, did come again and again, and always in one of two places—in the
Blue Room, or beside “The Pot.” That strange freak of Nature had
been the favourite resort of the lovers in the bygone time. Agnes counted the
time for the approach of the spirit; those who waited upon her could tell when
she believed the time for the appearance was near, by the peculiar light in her
eyes, and the glow upon her cheek. At such times the superstitious servants
hastened to get out of the room. After a while Agnes became conscious that
these things were noticed and commented upon, and it became her practice, when
she felt the time coming, to retire to her own room and lock herself in.
</p>

<p>
Reflecting upon these periodical visits of what she really believed was the
spirit of her dead lover, Agnes naturally went on to consider the whole
question of the existence of supernatural beings. She purchased works upon
demonology and witchcraft, and being an accomplished scholar did not confine
her studies to her own language, but read deeply in Agrippa, and the
necromancers of the Middle Ages. There were those who said that while upon the
Continent she plunged into these forbidden mysteries, and found in the recesses
of foreign capitals, men with whom there still lingered the knowledge how to
control the spirits of the air. In part this was true; whether self-deceived or
not, it was certain that Agnes really believed there were genii with whom she
could converse almost at pleasure. How was it then that, always anxious for
Warren’s presence, she yet disliked The Towers?
</p>

<p>
Soon after she began to study these magical books, and to attempt to penetrate
the veil which covers the ethereal world from the eyes of poor humanity, it
appeared to her that whenever Walter came, his face wore a sad aspect, almost
of upbraiding. And beside him there rose up a Darkness: something without form
and void, and yet which was there—something which chilled her blood.
After a while it began to take the shape of a thin column of darkness; even in
the broad sunlight there was this spot where no light would penetrate. It came
too without Walter; it rose up in the middle of the room where she sat—a
dark presence, a shadow which haunted her everywhere.
</p>

<p>
I cannot explain this; I can only record that it was the case. It was this that
made Agnes dislike The Towers, and live in the new wing. Yet even there she did
not escape. The shadow took a shape.
</p>

<p>
There is a sentence in a certain grand old book, which prays that we may be
delivered from the pestilence which walketh in darkness. The thought of that is
awful enough. But there is something more awful still. Ancient books, which
mention such things in a far-off manner, as if one were speaking under the
breath, refer in a dim way to the noonday phantom—the phantom which meets
the huntsman at midday in the green and shady wood; which stops the maiden at
the fountain with her pitcher, in the glare of the sunbeams; which addresses
the shepherd suddenly upon the hillside as he watches his sheep under the blue
vault of the sky. To the darkness and the night, the spirits seem to have a
natural claim—it is their realm; the boldest of us have sometimes felt an
unaccountable creeping in the thick darkness. But at noonday, when one would
naturally feel safe, by one’s side in the daylight, this is a thousand
times worse. The noonday phantom came to Agnes. The dark shadow, the thin
column of darkness like smoke, took to itself a shape.
</p>

<h3>Four.</h3>

<p>
Ever since the world began it has been the belief of mankind that desolate
places are the special haunt of supernatural beings. To this day the merchants
who travel upon camels across the deserts of the East, are firmly persuaded
that they can hear strange voices calling them from among the sandhills, and
that at dusk wild figures may be seen gliding over the ruins of long-lost
cities. It is useless to demonstrate that the curious noises of the desert, are
caused by the tension which the dead silence causes upon the nerves of the ear,
or by the shifting of the sand, and the currents of air which the heated
surface of the sand makes whirl about. The belief is so natural that it cannot
be entirely eradicated. In the olden times in our own fair England, and not so
very long ago either, there was not a wild and unfrequented place which had not
got its spirit. The woods had their elves and wild huntsmen, the meadows their
fairies, the fountains their nymphs, the rocks and caves their dwarfs, and the
air at night was crowded with witches travelling to and fro.
</p>

<p>
Let any one who possesses a vivid imagination and a highly-wrought nervous
system, even now, in this nineteenth century, with all the advantages of
learning and science, go and sit among the rocks, or in the depths of the wood
and think of immortality, and all that that word really means, and by-and-by a
mysterious awe will creep into the mind, and it will half believe in the
possibility of seeing or meeting something—<i>something</i>—it
knows not exactly what.
</p>

<p>
Agnes Lechester went into the desolate places fully expecting to meet her
lover, and she met—
</p>

<p>
A more desolate place than the Kickwell Pot could not easily be found in
highly-cultivated England, so near to an inhabited mansion. Even in winter,
when the leaves were off the trees, there was not a place where a view could be
got of it from the mansion, and when there the visitor was, to all intents and
purposes, isolated from the world. In summer it was still more hidden, for the
thick leaves above, and the tall brake fern growing luxuriantly beneath,
obstructed the view, and it was impossible to see for more than a dozen yards.
There was but one spot from whence it was possible to overlook “The
Pot,” and that was from the summit of the Down on the right. But this
Down was totally deserted. The very sheep kept aloof from it. Its steep sides
were almost inaccessible even to their nimble feet, and the soil was so
thin—that no herbage grew to reward the bold climber. Shepherds kept
their flocks away from that neighbourhood, for if a sheep lost its footing and
stumbled, there was no escape. The body must roll and rebound till it reached
the swift river below, which running between steep banks was not easy to get
at, and death by drowning was certain. In the course of time many had been lost
in this way, and now care was taken that the flocks should not travel in that
direction. Animal life almost entirely avoided the bare chalk cliffs. Sometimes
a hawk would linger on the edge, as it were, poising himself on his wings but a
few feet above the ridge, as if glorying in defiance of the depth below.
Sometimes a solitary crow would alight upon the hill, to devour the spoil it
had carried off, in peace and undisturbed. In the fir plantation on the other
side of the river a few pigeons built, and now and then a loud jay chattered,
and a squirrel peeped out from the topmost branches among the cones. The
woodpecker might be heard now and then tapping in the great beech trees, and a
brown rabbit would start out from among the fern. But so far as man was
concerned the spot was totally desolate: no path passed near, the common people
avoided it. It was a desolate place.
</p>

<p>
In summer time a place to meditate in. To sit upon the sward, leaning back
against the vast trunk of the dead oak tree, listening to the gentle murmur of
the river, as it rose up out of the mouth of “The Pot” close to the
feet. In winter a weird and sinister spot, when the trees were bare and dark,
the fir trees gloomy and black, when the snow lodged in great drifts upon the
Downs, and the murmur of the river rose to a dull, sullen roar, resounding up
the strange, natural funnel. When the grey clouds hung over the sky, and the
mist clung to the hill, and the occasional gusts of bitter wind rustled the
dead beech leaves—then indeed it was a desolate place. It was here that
the darkness, the thin column of smoke-like darkness, began to grow into form
and shape; and as it took to itself a figure, so the vision of poor Walter
faded away, and lost its distinctness of outline.
</p>

<p>
Agnes saw before her a something that was half-human and half-divine; and yet
which a species of instinct told her was not wholly good, perhaps only
apparently good. The face was human and yet not human—so much grander,
nobler, full of passions, stronger, more irresistible than ever yet played upon
the features of a man. The brow spoke of power illimitable, of foresight
infinite, of design, and deep, fathomless thought. The chin and mouth spoke of
iron will, of strength to rive the solid rock and overthrow a tower, of a
purpose relentlessly pursued. The eyes were unbearable, searching, burning like
a flame of fire. The form uncertain, ill-defined, yet full of a flowing grace
and majestic grandeur. It was winged. There was a general resemblance between
this being and those strange creatures—half man, half deity—which
are depicted upon the slabs from the palace at Nineveh; only that those
pictures are flat and tame, spiritless, mere outline representations. This was
full of an intense vitality—a magnetic vigour.
</p>

<p>
It did not speak; yet she understood its thoughts and its wishes. They filled
her with a swelling hope, and yet with unutterable dread:—to place
herself willingly, unhesitatingly, without a grain of distrust, within those
arms; to be folded to its breast; to feel the wings spread out, and to rush
with breathless haste into space, seeking the home of the immortals, the bride
of a spirit. The pride of her mind found an unspeakable joy in the belief that
such a fate was possible for her—nay, was ever waiting for her—it
was but for her to step forward, and in a moment—
</p>

<p>
The illimitable ambition of her soul urged her on. She never doubted the
possibility—“And the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were
fair”—what happened then could happen now. Yet something held her
back, and that something was Walter—the faint indistinct vision of
Walter. He seemed to shake his head mournfully, to beckon with his hand, to
grow paler and unhappy, as her frame of mind disposed her more and more to join
the ineffable being which stood before her. The warfare, as it were; the
struggle between the two grew insupportable; she was torn with conflicting
thoughts, doubts, and fears. This was one reason why she so earnestly desired
companionship; and in the presence of Violet she found temporary relief.
</p>

<p>
The offer of Marese Baskette introduced a new element of trouble and confusion
in her mind. She had, as it were, a double existence; she lived two lives. One,
visible to others with men and woman, mortal like herself; the other, unseen,
was spent with the spirit of the dead, and with a spirit which had never known
mortality. Yet it was not two minds, but one mind; for all through this dual
nature there ran the same master chord. As in the physical life, so in the
mental. In the physical life, the proud position Marese offered her attracted
her irresistibly; so, in the mental life, the figure of Walter grew fainter and
fainter, and that of the Genius, offering supremacy and superiority, became
more distinct, larger, and more powerful. The struggle now lay between Marese
and the Genius—the vision of the dead Walter faded entirely away. Which
should she choose—an earthly kingdom, or little less, with opportunities
such as had never before fallen to the lot of a mortal; or should she soar up
into the empyrean on the breast of that wonderful and glorious being who grew
brighter, more lovely, the longer she gazed upon him?
</p>

<p>
It was the spirit she went to meet by day and night at the side of “The
Pot.”
</p>

<p>
It was the belief among the ancients that persons afflicted with certain
diseases, or of unsound mind, were possessed by spirits; and still further,
they seem to have quite understood that the possessed person had, as it were,
two evils at once. The disease was not the spirit, nor the spirit the disease.
These were distinct. Those who could exorcise the spirit had also to cure the
disease, though the one generally followed the other.
</p>

<p>
It is hard to understand the intense reality of the vision seen by Agnes,
except upon some similar theory. That the inherent insanity of the Lechester
family had developed itself in her mind, unsuspected by others, there can be no
doubt; but even to the persons who are subject to illusions of the mind, the
reality of their visions is seldom, if ever, so absolutely believed in as these
were by Lady Agnes. There is just the possibility, even atheists will not deny
the <i>possibility</i>—but it is better not to argue the matter. It is
sad, indeed, to record the affliction which had fallen upon this most estimable
and generous woman, if we regard it as insanity only; if we go a step further,
and admit the possibility alluded to, it is sadder still.
</p>

<p>
At home, in the new wing, the darkness rarely came now, though there was the
sense of a presence. It was by the side of “The Pot” that the
figure showed itself fully. It rose up from the strange funnel, as if a mist
hardened and solidified into shape. It stood before her silent, yet speaking
unutterable things.
</p>

<p>
In the cold winter, when the sky was grey with cloud, the firs black and
gloomy, and the drifted snow lay in heaps upon the Downs, there mingled with
the sullen roar of the river resounding up “The Pot,” a voice from
this mysterious being, which in the savage, fierce desolation of that place
spoke of a pride, of an ambition, which rose above even utter failure and
degradation. Of a strength of mind which gloried even in its fall; which defied
the very heavens in its grandeur; which could not be subdued—immortal in
its pride.
</p>

<p>
As the spring stole on and the soft rain fell, as the buds sprang forth and the
thrush sang with joy, the figure grew brighter; an intense vitality seemed to
pass from it to her—a glow of life which said, “Come with me; we
will wander amid forests such as earth even in its youth never saw, by the
shore of lakes such as mortal eye never gazed upon; we will revel in an
immortal youth—in a sunshine inconceivable in beauty.”
</p>

<p>
It was but a step to those arms; she longed, yet she did not take it. At night,
when the sky glittered with stars and a solitary planet beamed in the west, the
eyes of the shape grew into blazing coals, and her soul was aware that it was
thinking of unutterable mysteries, of knowledge locked up for ages and ages, in
the infinite space beyond those points of light. Oh, to penetrate into that
silent chamber, to walk with reverent footsteps in that library of the
universe, to read the wondrous truths written there—to read which was, in
itself, life eternal! This, in brief, the spirit spoke to her.
</p>

<p>
It will now be understood why the strange behaviour of Lady Agnes seemed to
grow stranger after the last visit of Marese Baskette and her practical
acceptance of his offer. The moment she had in a manner given her hand to him,
the claims of the other and supernatural life appeared to be infinitely
superior—as is the common case when one has decided, the other course
always seems preferable. Yet she could not easily withdraw from her word, nor
indeed did she altogether wish to do so; and this indecision drove her into a
restless frame of mind. Her visits to “The Pot” became more and
more frequent—some times she would go there four times in the course of
the day, and once again in the evening. She shut herself in her private
room—the one room Violet was never asked to enter—for hours almost
every day. There was a restless gleam in her eyes, usually so mild and
pleasant.
</p>

<p>
One evening, after a more than ordinarily restless day had been spent, Agnes
suddenly rose up, and retired to her private room. This was usually her custom
before going out alone into the park, but on this occasion, Violet watching
her, saw to her intense surprise that, instead of leaving the house, she
unlocked a door which led into the old mansion, and entered the long deserted
apartments of The Towers proper. Such a step would have been under any ordinary
circumstances nothing to take notice of, but Violet had gradually worked
herself up into a state of alarm, and this unusual proceeding created more
surmises in her mind even than the lonely walks in the darkness. She slipped
out of the house thinking to watch Agnes’ progress through The Towers by
the light she carried, which would show which rooms she went into. It fell out
exactly as she had supposed—she saw the light of the little lamp flit
about from window to window and along the corridors, now disappearing from
sight entirely, and now suddenly flickering out again, till at last it stopped
in what Violet well knew was the Blue Room. This room was so called from the
colour employed in decorating the walls. They were painted instead of being
papered, much in the same style as the houses at Pompeii, only in larger
panels, and the ground colour was blue. From the lawn in front of the house
Violet could just see Agnes seated at a table in this room, and before her was
a small desk—a desk she had often noticed in that room, thinking how
incongruous a plain gentleman’s writing-desk, with brass handles, looked
amidst the elegant furniture and decorations.
</p>

<p>
Out of this desk Agnes was taking what, at that distance, Violet could only
conjecture were letters, and burning them one by one in the flame of the lamp.
</p>

<p>
Presently she paused, and Violet saw her kiss something which looked like a
curl of chestnut hair. Then not fancying her self-imposed task of watching her
benefactress, and convinced that there was no danger, Violet stole away.
</p>

<p>
Agnes was, in fact, destroying her memorials of Walter De Warren, which she had
kept in his own desk in the room in which she had last seen him alive. She had
determined to cast aside all remembrance of him; his memory should not
embarrass her in the course she would pursue. Freed from the slightest control
by him, she thought that she would be the better able to choose between the
earthly and the immortal destinies offered to her. Yet she still lingered,
still hesitated. She could not say to Marese “I will,” nor could
she say “I will not.” She permitted his money to be used in freeing
her estate of encumbrance, and this gave him a moral claim upon her hand. After
that was done, it seemed to her that the spirit who visited her at “The
Pot” visibly frowned, and the great eyes were full of reproach.
</p>

<p>
What was this feeble earthly glory to that which was offered to her in the sky?
She had chosen wrongly, contrary to the spirit of the proud and ambitious
Lechesters; she was acting in opposition to the traditions of her race. Marese,
after all, was a low-born upstart. The ancestry of the spirit had no beginning
and no end. Again she hesitated.
</p>

<p>
About this time there came a letter from Miss Merton, dated Torquay, written in
a formal but polite manner, begging to be informed what she had better do with
the dog Dando. She did not wish to get rid of him—she had become quite
attached to the dog and he to her—but she was not the actual owner, and
she did not like the responsibility of having so valuable an animal with her.
</p>

<p>
It seemed as if the value of the dog was well known, for at least two
deliberate attempts had been made to steal it within a few days. And these
attempts had not a little alarmed Miss Merton. To find that her steps were
watched and followed by a wild-looking tramp, or tinker fellow, bent upon
carrying off the dog was, to say the least, extremely unpleasant.
</p>

<p>
The man—an ill-looking fellow—was always about the house, and would
not go away. He played a tin whistle, and whenever the dog heard some peculiar
notes, he became greatly excited, and began to dance about in a curious manner.
Not only that, but if the tramp varied the tune in some way, then the dog grew
frantic to run after him, and twice she had the utmost difficulty to recover
him.
</p>

<p>
What was she to do? She did not like to part with the dog, and yet really it
was very awkward.
</p>

<p>
Violet in reply asked Miss Merton to send her Dando. She had now got over her
prejudice against him and felt that her anger had been unjust. She should like
to have him back again. As to the tramp, she was not surprised, for she
remembered that her poor father had bought the dog, when quite young, from a
band of strolling gipsies, and there were certain tunes which had always
excited him to dance and frisk about as if he had been trained to do so.
</p>

<p>
Violet, of course, asked Lady Lechester’s permission, whose reply was
that she should be glad to have the dog; there was plenty of room for him, and
he would be company, and add to the safety of the somewhat lonely Towers.
Violet herself thought that it would be a great advantage if Dando should
happen to please Agnes’ fancy; he might be allowed to accompany her in
her lonely dark walks, and would be some protection.
</p>

<p>
A week afterwards Dando came, and at once recognised Violet. He had grown
considerably larger, and was a fine, noble animal.
</p>

<p>
As Violet had hoped, Agnes took a great fancy to him, and the dog returning it,
they became inseparable companions. This <i>relieved</i> Violet of much of her
anxiety.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Five.</h3>

<p>
A fortnight after Dando’s establishment at The Towers, Aymer came. He
looked ill, pale, and careworn, and at once announced that he had left Mr
Broughton, and was going to London, literally to seek his fortune.
</p>

<p>
The monotony had at last proved too much for him, and worse than that was the
miserable thought that, after all this work and patience, he was no nearer to
Violet. Perhaps after ten or fifteen years of unremitting labour, nine-tenths
of which time must be spent at a distance from her, he might, if his health
lasted and no accident happened, be in receipt of one hundred and fifty pounds
per annum; and how much more forward would he be then?
</p>

<p>
Not all the poverty and restraint of the years upon Wick Farm at World’s
End, not all the terrible disappointment on the very day when every hope seemed
on the point of realisation; nothing could dull his vivid imagination, or make
him abate one iota of the future which he had marked out for Violet.
</p>

<p>
In truth, she wondered why he had never asked her to come to him—to be
married and live with him in his humble lodgings at Barnham. She would have
been happy and content. But to Aymer the idea was impossible. All the romance
of his life was woven around her head; he would not bring her to miserable back
rooms, to a confined narrow life in a third-class street. It would have been to
admit that his whole being was a failure; that he had formed hopes and dreamed
dreams beyond his power ever to grasp, and his spirit was not yet broken to
that. No, he would struggle and work, and bear anything for Violet’s
sake. Anything but this miserable monotony without progress. Had there been
progress, however slow, he might have tamed his impatient mind and forced
himself to endure it.
</p>

<p>
Day after day passed, the nights came and went, and each morning found him
precisely in the same position as before. His organisation was too sensitive,
too highly wrought, eager, nervous, for the dull plodding of daily life. He
chafed against it, till dark circles formed themselves under his
eyelids—circles which sleep would not remove. These were partly caused by
overwork.
</p>

<p>
Broughton, on returning from Stirmingham, found his affairs at Barnham had got
into a fearful state of muddle, and Aymer had to assist him to clear the Augean
stable of accumulated correspondence, and satisfy neglected clients. Often,
after a long day’s work, he had to carry accounts or correspondence home
with him and finish it there, and then after that he would open his own plain
simple desk—much such a desk as the one that had belonged to poor Cornet
De Warren—and resume his interrupted MS.
</p>

<p>
After a while it became unbearable; the poor fellow grew desperate. He might
not have so soon given way, had not a slight attack of illness, not sufficient
to confine him in-doors, added to the tension of his nerves. He determined to
stay on until his MS was finished—till the last word had been written,
and the last sketch elaborated—then he would go to London, no matter what
became of him. If all else failed he could, at the last, return to Wick Farm;
they would give him a bed and a crust, and he would be no worse off than
before.
</p>

<p>
He toiled at his book at midnight, and long hours afterwards, when the good
people of Barnham town were calmly sleeping the sleep of the just, and
permitting the talent in their midst to eat its own heart. At last it was
finished, and he left.
</p>

<p>
Mr Broughton wished him to stay, offered to increase his salary, said that he
had become really useful, and even, as a personal favour, begged him to remain.
Aymer thanked him sincerely, but was firm—he must go. So far as was
possible he explained to Broughton the reason, and the lawyer, hard as he was,
had sufficient power of understanding others to perceive the real state of
affairs. He warned Aymer that certain disappointment awaited him in London,
that no publisher would issue a book by an unknown author unless paid for it.
Aymer shook his head sadly—he had known that well enough long ago, but he
must go.
</p>

<p>
Broughton shook hands with him, gave him a five-pound note over and above his
salary, and told him if in distress, as he prophesied he would certainly soon
be, to write to him, or else return.
</p>

<p>
Aymer again thanked him, packed his modest little portmanteau, and taking with
him his manuscript, went to The Towers to say farewell to Violet.
</p>

<p>
When Agnes understood the course he had decided on, she said that she thought
he had done right. To any other she should have said differently; to any other
of a less highly organised mind she should have said, “Why, you cannot
find a better opening.” But what would have been meat to others was
poison to Aymer. Therefore she applauded his resolution, and told him to go
forth and conquer, but first to stay a few days with Violet.
</p>

<p>
This language greatly cheered poor Aymer, and for a few days he was in a
species of Paradise.
</p>

<p>
It was not even yet fully spring—the wind was cold at times, but still
they could go out freely; and with Violet at his side, and Dando bounding along
in front, it seemed almost like a return to the old joyous times at
World’s End.
</p>

<p>
The hours flew by, and when the last day came it seemed as if but a few minutes
had elapsed. It happened to be a wet day—the spring showers were falling
steadily, and, unable to go out, they rambled into the old mansion, and
strolled from room to room.
</p>

<p>
The groom had been ordered to get the dog-cart out by a certain time to take
Aymer seven miles to the nearest railway station. That station was but a small
one, and two up-trains only stopped there in the course of the day—if he
missed this he would not reach London that night.
</p>

<p>
Forgetful of time, perhaps half purposely forgetful, Aymer lingered on, and
could not tear himself away.
</p>

<p>
At length the groom, tired of waiting in the rain, and anxious about the time,
waived all ceremony, and came to seek his passenger.
</p>

<p>
Aymer pressed Violet’s hand, kissed it, and was gone, not daring to look
back.
</p>

<p>
The wheels grated on the gravel, and Violet remained where he had left her.
</p>

<p>
Agnes came presently and found her, and started. The farewell had been given in
the Blue Room.
</p>

<p>
“You did not say farewell here?” said Agnes, with emphasis.
</p>

<p>
Violet admitted it.
</p>

<p>
“Good Heavens—what an evil omen!” muttered Agnes, and drew
her from the spot.
</p>

<p>
From that very room De Warren had gone, forth to his fate: from that room Aymer
had started to win himself a way in the world.
</p>

<p>
It was late at night when he reached London. Nothing could be done till the
morning. As he had no experience of the ways of the metropolis, Aymer naturally
paid about half as much again as was necessary, and reckoning up his slender
stock of money, foresaw that he could not long remain in town at this rate.
</p>

<p>
Mr Broughton had given him a written introduction to a firm of law-publishers
and stationers with whom he dealt—not that they would be of any use to
him in themselves, but in the idea that they might have connections who could
serve him.
</p>

<p>
Upon these gentlemen he waited in the morning, and was fairly well received.
They gave him a note to another firm who were in a more popular line of
business. Aymer trudged thither, and found these people very off-handed and
very busy. They glanced at his manuscript—not in their line. Had he
anything that would be likely to take with boys?—illustrated fiction sold
best for boys and girls. Ah, well! they were sorry and very busy. Suppose he
tried so-and-so?
</p>

<p>
This process, or pretty much the same process, was repeated for two or three
days, until poor Aymer, naturally enough, lost heart.
</p>

<p>
As he left one publisher’s shop, a clerk, who was writing at his desk
near the door, noticed his careworn look, and having once gone through a
somewhat similar experience, and seeing “gentleman” marked upon his
features, asked him if he would show him the work.
</p>

<p>
Aymer did so. The clerk, an experienced man, turned over the illustrations
carefully, and then appeared to ponder.
</p>

<p>
“These are good,” he said; “they would certainly take if they
were published. But so also would a great many other things. The difficulty is
to get them published, unless you have a name. Now take my advice—It is
useless carrying the MS from door to door. You may tramp over London without
success. Your best plan will be to bring it out at your own cost; once out you
will get a reputation, and then you can sell your next. I don’t want to
be personal, but have you any money? I see—you have a little. Well, you
need not pay all the cost. Go to so-and-so—offer them, let me see,
such-and-such a sum, and not a shilling more, and your business is done.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer, as he walked along busy Fleet Street and up into the Strand, thought
over this advice, and it sounded reasonable enough—too reasonable. For he
had so little money. When all he had saved from the gift of fifty pounds, his
salary, and Broughton’s present, were added together, he had but
forty-seven pounds. Out of this he was advised to expend forty pounds in one
lump; to him it seemed like risking a fortune. But Violet? His book? He could
not help, even after all his disappointments, feeling a certain faith in his
book.
</p>

<p>
Westwards he walked, past the famous bronze lions, and the idea came into his
mind—How did the hero of Trafalgar win his fame? Was it not by courage
only—simple courage? On, then. He went to the firm mentioned. They
haggled for a larger sum; but Aymer was firm, for the simple reason that he had
no more to give. Then they wanted a few days to consider.
</p>

<p>
This he could not refuse; and these days passed slowly, while his stock of
money diminished every hour. Finally they agreed to publish the work, but bound
him down to such conditions, that it was hard to see how he could recover a
tenth part of his investment, much less obtain a profit. He signed the
agreement, paid the money, and walked forth.
</p>

<p>
He went up the steps to the National Gallery, barely knowing what he did. He
stood and gazed down upon the great square, with the lions and the fountains,
and the busy stream of human life flowing for ever round it. A proud feeling
swelled up within. At last his book would be seen and read, his name would be
known, and then—Violet!
</p>

<p>
Days and weeks went by, and yet no proofs came to his humble lodgings, or
rather sleeping place, for all day he wandered to and fro in the great city.
When he called at the publishers’ office they treated him with
supercilious indifference, and—“Really did not know that the
immediate appearance of the little book was so important.” There were
other works they had had in hand previously, and which must have priority.
</p>

<p>
Aymer wandered about, not only into the great thoroughfares and the famous
streets of the City and West End, but eastwards down to the docks, filled with
curiosity, observing everything, storing his mind with facts and
characteristics for future use, and meantime starving—for it was rapidly
coming to that; and the descent was facilitated by a misfortune which befell
him in Shoreditch, where, as he was standing near a passage or court in a
crowd, a thief made off with three pounds out of his remaining five.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to say—Why did not Aymer get work? But how was he to do so
with no money to advertise, no introductions, no kind of security to give, a
perfect stranger? He did try. He called upon some firms who advertised in the
<i>Telegraph</i>. The very first question was—Where do you come from? The
country! That answer was sufficient. They wanted a man up to London work and to
the ways of the City. Aymer modestly said he could learn. “Yes,”
they replied, “and we must pay for your education. Good morning.”
</p>

<p>
Economise as much as he would, the two pounds left dwindled and dwindled, till
the inevitable end came, and the last half sovereign melted into five
shillings, the five shillings into half-a-crown, the half-a-crown into a single
solitary shilling. Driven to the last extremity, Aymer hit upon the idea of
manual labour. He was not a powerful man, he could not lift a heavy weight, but
he could bear a great deal of fatigue. He looked round him, he saw hundreds at
work, and yet there did not seem any place where he could go and ask for
employment.
</p>

<p>
By a kind of instinct he wandered down to the river and along the wharves.
There he saw men busy unloading the barges and smaller craft. Summoning up
courage, he spoke to one of the labourers, who stared, and then burst into a
broad grin. Aymer turned away, but was called back. The ganger looked him up
and down and offered him half-a-crown a day; the others earned three shillings
and sixpence and four shillings, but they were strong, strapping fellows. Aymer
accepted it, for indeed he could not help himself and in a few minutes the
poet, author, artist, with his coat off, was rolling small casks across the
wharf. At first he was awkward, and hurt himself; the rest laughed at him, but
good-humouredly. Some offered him beer.
</p>

<p>
At six o’clock he, with the rest, was called to a small office and
received his day’s wages—two shillings and sixpence. He made a
meal, the first that day, at a cheap eating-house, and then set out to return
to his wretched lodgings, tired, worn out, miserable, yet not despairing, for
he had found a means which would enable him to live, and to wait—to wait
till the book came out.
</p>

<p>
For a fortnight Aymer worked at the wharf, and had become a favourite with the
men. Noting his handiness and activity, and seeing that he was well educated,
he was now put into an office of some little trust, to check the goods as they
were landed, and received an advance of eighteen-pence, making a daily wage of
four shillings. This seemed an immense improvement; but he was obliged to
borrow a week’s extra salary in advance to buy a new pair of boots, and
was therefore very little better off.
</p>

<p>
Strolling slowly one evening up Cannon Street, Aymer met the great stream of
city men and merchants, clerks and agents, which at that time pours out of the
warehouses and offices, setting across London Bridge towards the suburbs.
</p>

<p>
He walked slowly, all but despondently. It was already a week since he had
written to Violet—that in itself was a strong proof of his condition of
mind. It is very easy for those who have got everything, to pray each Sunday
against envy, and to repeat with unction the response after the command not to
covet thy neighbour’s goods. It is a different matter when one is
practically destitute, when the mere value of the chain that hangs so daintily
from my lady’s neck—ay, the price of the muff that warms her
delicate hands—would be as a fortune, and lift the heart up out of the
mire.
</p>

<p>
He could not help thinking that if he had but the money, the value, of a single
much-despised pony that drew a greengrocer’s cart he should be almost a
prince.
</p>

<p>
He passed under Temple Bar, and entered the busy Strand, walking, as it
happened—events always happen, and no one can say what that word really
means—on the right hand pavement, facing westwards. Painfully and wearily
walking, he came to the church where the pavement makes a détour, and
hesitated for a moment whether to cross to the other side or go round the
church, and decided, as the road was dirty, and his old boots thin and full of
holes, to follow the pavement. “Circumstances over which we have no
control”—these circumstances generally commence in the smallest,
least noticeable trifles. It so happened—there it is again—will
anyone explain why it so happened?—that as he reached the entrance to
Holywell Street, he glanced up it, and saw for the first time that avenue of
old books. The author’s instinct made him first pause, and then go up
it—he was tired, but he must go and look. Dingy and dirty, but tempting
to a man whose library had been obtained by wiring hares. He thought, with a
sigh, how many more books he could have bought with his money had he known of
the existence of this cheap mart, or had he had any access to it. Here was
Bohn’s Plato—for which he had paid a hardly got thirty
shillings—marked up at fifteen shillings, slightly soiled it was true,
but what did that matter? Here was old
Herodotus—Bohn’s—marked at eighteen-pence, the very book
which had cost him three hares, including carriage. The margins were all
scribbled over—odd faces and odder animals rudely sketched in pen and
ink, evidently some schoolboy’s crib. But what did that matter, so long
as the text was complete—he cared for nothing but the text. As he
lingered and heard the bells chiming seven o’clock, his eye caught sight
of a little book called “A Fortune for a Shilling.”
</p>

<p>
It was a catching title; he remembered seeing it lying upon the itinerant
bookseller’s stall in front of the Sternhold Hall. He looked at it,
weighed it in his hand. He smiled sadly at his own folly. He had but fifteen
pence in his pocket, and to think of throwing a whole shilling away upon such a
lottery! It was absurd—childish; and yet the book fascinated him. The
bookseller’s assistant came out, ostensibly to dust the
books—really to see that none were pocketed. Aymer ran his eye down the
pages of the book, feeling all the while as if he were cheating the bookseller
of his money. The assistant said, “Only one shilling, sir; a chance for
everybody, sir, in that book.” Aymer shut his eyes to his own folly, paid
the money, and returned into the Strand with threepence left.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Six.</h3>

<p>
He repented his folly very speedily, for the landlady had advanced him
half-a-crown two days before for some necessaries, and now asked him for the
money.
</p>

<p>
Not all the hunger and thirst of downright destitution is so hard to bear to a
proud spirit as the insults of a petty creditor. He could not taste his tea;
the dry bread—he could not afford butter—stuck in his throat. If he
had not spent that shilling, he might have paid a part at least of his debt.
</p>

<p>
He took up the book—the cause of his depression—and, still ashamed
of himself, began to search it for any reference to his own name. In vain;
Malet was not mentioned, there were no unclaimed legacies, no bank dividends
accumulating, no estates without an owner waiting for him to take
possession—it was an absolute blank. The shilling had been utterly
wasted.
</p>

<p>
As he sat thinking over his position, the idea occurred to him to see what
mention the book made of the great estate at Stirmingham.
</p>

<p>
There were pages upon pages devoted to Sibbolds and Baskettes, just as he
expected. Aymer ran down the list, recalling, as he went, the scenes he had
witnessed in the Sternhold Hall.
</p>

<p>
At the foot of one page was a short note in small type, and a name which caught
his eye—“Bury Wick Church.” He read it—it stated that
it was uncertain what had become of Arthur Sibbold, the heir by the entail, and
that inquiries had failed to elucidate his fate. There was a statement, made on
very little authority, that he had been buried in Bury Wick Church, co.
B—, but researches there had revealed nothing. Either he had died a
pauper, and had been interred without a tombstone, or else <i>he had changed
his name</i>. It was this last sentence that in an instant threw a flood of
light, as it were, into Aymer’s mind—<i>changed his name</i>.
</p>

<p>
Full of excitement, he rushed to his little portmanteau, tore out his
note-book, and quickly found the memorandum made in the office of Mr Broughton,
at Barnham.
</p>

<p>
There was the explanation of the disappearance of Arthur Sibbold—there
was the advertisement in a small local newspaper of his intended marriage and
change of name. Doubtless he had afterwards been known as Mr Waldron—had
been buried as Waldron, and his death registered as Waldron. As Waldron of The
Place, World’s End! Then poor old Jason Waldron, the kindest man that
ever lived, was in reality the true heir to the vast estate at Stirmingham.
</p>

<p>
Jason was dead, but Violet remained. Violet was the heiress. He sat, perfectly
overwhelmed with his own discovery, of which he never entertained a
moment’s doubt. He ransacked his memory of what he had heard at the
family council; tried to recall the evidence that had been produced at that
memorable <i>fiasco</i>; but found it hard to do so, for at the time his mind
was far away with Violet, and he had no personal interest in the proceedings.
Had he only known—what an opportunity he would have had—he might
have learnt the smallest particulars.
</p>

<p>
Thinking intently upon it, it seemed to him that the name of Arthur Sibbold was
rarely, if ever, mentioned at that conference, it was always <i>James</i>
Sibbold; Arthur seemed to have dropped out of the list altogether.
</p>

<p>
If he could read a copy of the “Life of Sternhold Baskette,”
perhaps he might be able to get a better understanding of the facts.
</p>

<p>
He deeply regretted now that he had not purchased a copy, as he might have done
so easily at Stirmingham, on the stall of the itinerant bookseller. Then he had
a little money; now he had none.
</p>

<p>
He called his landlady, took up his great coat, and gave it to her—could
she sell it? She looked it over, found many faults, but finally went out with
it. In half an hour she returned with eighteen shillings.
</p>

<p>
Aymer had given three pounds for it just before his wedding-day. He paid the
old lady her half-crown, and hurried back to Holywell Street. The book he
wanted, however, was not so easily to be found. All had heard of it—but
no one had it.
</p>

<p>
In time he was directed to a man who dealt in genealogical works, sold deeds,
autographs, and similar trash. Here he found the book, and had a haggle for it,
finally securing it for seven shillings and sixpence; the fellow would have
been glad of three shillings, for it had been on his shelves for years, but
Aymer was burning with impatience. In the preface he found a scanty account of
the Sibbolds, not one-fifth as much as he had reckoned upon, for the book was
devoted to Sternhold, the representative man of the Baskettes. There was,
however, a pretty accurate narrative of the murder of Will Baskette, and from
that Aymer incidentally obtained much that he wanted. Reflecting upon the
murder, and trying to put himself in Arthur Sibbold’s place, Aymer
arrived at a nearly perfect conception of the causes which led him to bury
himself, as it were, out of sight.
</p>

<p>
One of two things was clear—either Arthur Sibbold had actually
participated in the murder, and was afraid of evidence unexpectedly turning up
against him; or else he had been deeply hurt with the suspicion that was cast
upon him, and had resolved for ever to abandon the home of his ancestors.
</p>

<p>
Probably he had travelled as far as possible from the scene of the
murder—perhaps to London (this was the case)—got employment, and,
being successful, finally married into the Waldron family, and changed his
name. He would naturally be reticent about his ancestors. The next generation
would forget all about it, and the third would never think to inquire.
</p>

<p>
Had the vast estate been in existence before Arthur Sibbold’s death, most
probably he would have made himself known; but it was clear that it had not
grown to one-fiftieth part of its present magnificence till long after.
</p>

<p>
The silence of Arthur Sibbold, and Arthur Sibbold’s descendant, was thus
readily and reasonably accounted for. Reading further, Aymer came to the
bargain which Sternhold Baskette had made with the sons of James Sibbold, and
of their transhipment to America. Here the legal knowledge that he had picked
up in the office of Mr Broughton enabled him to perceive several points that
would not otherwise have occurred to him. That transaction was obviously null
and void, if at the time it was concluded either Arthur Sibbold, or Arthur
Sibbold’s descendants, were living. They were the lawful owners of the
old farm at Wolf’s Glow, and of the Dismal Swamp, and it was impossible
for James Sibbold’s children to transfer the estate to another person.
All then that it was necessary to prove was that Violet was the direct
descendant of Arthur Sibbold, and her claim would be at once irresistible. Then
it occurred to him that at the family council he had often heard mention made
of a certain deed of entail which was missing, and for which the members of the
Sibbold detachment had offered large sums of money.
</p>

<p>
The long, long hours and days that he had spent in the Sternhold Hall
chronicling the proceedings of the council, and which he had at the time so
heartily hated soon proved of the utmost value. He could at once understand
what was wanted, and perceive the value of the smallest link of evidence. Here
was one link obviously wanting—the deed. Without that deed the descent of
Violet from Arthur Sibbold was comparatively of small account. It was possible
that even then she might be a co-heiress; but without that deed—which
specially included female heiresses—she would not be able to claim the
entire estate. Yet even then, as the direct descendant of the elder brother,
her claim would be extremely valuable, and far more likely to succeed than the
very distant chance of the American Sibbolds or Baskettes, all of whom laboured
under the disadvantage that their forefathers had sold their birthright for a
mess of pottage. Another and far more serious difficulty which occurred to him
as he thought over the matter, far into the night, was the absence of proof of
Arthur Sibbold’s marriage. It was clear from the little book whose notes
had opened his eyes, that the register of the church at Bury Wick,
World’s End, had been searched, and no record found. His memorandum of
the advertisement of change of name described Arthur Sibbold as of Middlesex;
the marriage therefore might have taken place in London. Probably Sibbold had
met the Miss Waldron he had afterwards married in town. Where then was he to
find the register of marriage? Middlesex was a wide definition. How many
churches were there in Middlesex? What a Herculean labour to search through
them all!
</p>

<p>
He was too much excited to sleep. Despite of all these drawbacks—the
disappearance of the deed, and the absence of the marriage
certificate—there was no reasonable doubt that Violet was the heiress of
the Stirmingham estates. The difficulties that were in the way appeared to him
as nothing; he would force his way through them. She should have her
rights—and then! He would search every church in London till he did find
the register of Arthur Sibbold’s marriage. It must be in existence
somewhere. If it was in existence he would find it. Towards two o’clock
in the morning he fell asleep, and, as a result, did not wake till ten next
day. Hurrying to his daily task, he was met with frowns and curses for neglect,
and venturing to remonstrate, was discharged upon the spot.
</p>

<p>
Here seemed an end at once to all his golden dreams. He walked back into the
City, and passing along Fleet Street, was stopped for a moment by a crowd of
people staring into the window of a print and bookshop, and talking excitedly.
A momentary curiosity led him to press through the crowd, till he could obtain
a view of the window. There he saw—wonder of wonders—one of his own
sketches, an illustration from his book, greatly enlarged, and printed in
colours. It was this that had attracted the crowd. The humour and yet the
pathos of the picture—the touch of Nature which makes the whole world
kin—had gone straight to their hearts. On every side he heard the
question, “Whose is it?”—“Who drew
it?”—“What’s the artist’s name?” Then the
title of the book was repeated, and “Who’s it
by?”—“Who wrote it?”—“I’ll get a
copy! Third Edition already—it must be good.”
</p>

<p>
Gratified, wonder-stricken, proud, and yet bewildered, Aymer at last got into
the shop and made inquiries. Then he learnt that the publisher had stolen a
march upon him. They had never sent him the proofs; they had in fact thought
very little of the book, till one day it happened (it happened again) a famous
artist came into the office, and chanced to turn over a leaf of the MS, which
was lying where Aymer had left it, on the publisher’s wide desk. This man
had a world-wide reputation, and feared no competitor; he could therefore do
justice to others. He was greatly struck with the sketches.
</p>

<p>
“This man will make hid fortune,” he said. “Why on earth do
you let the book lie here mouldering?”
</p>

<p>
The publisher said nothing, but next day the manuscript was put in hand,
hurried out, and well advertised. The first and second edition sold out in a
week, and Aymer heard nothing of it till accident led him into the crowd round
the shop window in Fleet Street.
</p>

<p>
It will be pardoned if I say that Aymer was prouder that day than ever he had
been in his life. He went straight to the publisher’s with a glowing
heart. The agreement had been that the publisher should have two editions for
his trouble and the use of his name; in the third, the author and artist was to
share. In point of fact, the publisher had never dreamt of the book reaching
even a second edition.
</p>

<p>
Aymer was received coldly. He asked for his share. Impossible—the
booksellers had not paid yet—the expense had been
enormous—advertising, etc, there would barely be a balance when all was
said and done. Aymer lost his temper, as well he might, and was very politely
requested to leave the premises. He did so, but hastened at once to his
adviser—the clerk who had told him to publish at his own risk. This man,
or rather gentleman, said he had expected him for days, and wondered why he had
not come.
</p>

<p>
“Wait till one o’clock,” said he, “and I will accompany
you.”
</p>

<p>
At one they revisited the offices of the publisher. The upshot was that Aymer
was presented with a cheque for fifty pounds, being his own forty pounds, and
ten pounds additional.
</p>

<p>
“Now,” said his friend, “you call on my employers—I
will mention your name—and offer them a work you have in hand.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer did so, and obtained a commission to write a work for them, to be
illustrated by himself, and was presented with a twenty-pound note as
earnest-money. Thus in a few hours, from a penniless outcast, he found himself
with seventy pounds in his pocket—with a name, and with a prospect of
constant and highly remunerative employment. If this continued, and of course
it would—not all his disappointments could quench his faith in his
destiny—he would marry Violet almost immediately. With this money he
could search out, and establish her claim; he would employ her own late
employer, Mr Broughton. He was anxious to write to Violet, but he had not
tasted food that day yet. He entered a restaurant and treated himself to a
really good dinner, with a little of the generous juice of the grape. Towards
five o’clock he sat himself down in his old room to write to Violet, and
to Mr Broughton.
</p>

<p>
He wrote and wrote and wrote, and still he could not conclude; his heart was
full, and he knew that there was a loving pair of eyes which would read every
line with delight. First about his book—sending, of course, two copies by
the same post—one for Violet, one for Lady Lechester—telling Violet
of the excitement it had caused, of the crowd in the street, of the anxiety to
learn the author’s name, of the first, second, third edition, and the
fourth in the press. Was it to be wondered at that he dilated upon this
subject?
</p>

<p>
Then he told her of his troubles, of his work at the wharf, and explained why
he had not written, and finally came to the discovery that Violet was the
heiress of Stirmingham. He had a difficult task to explain to her how this
arose; he had to review the whole history of the case in as short a compass as
possible, and to put the links of evidence clearly, so that a non-technical
mind could grasp them. He finished with a declaration of his intention to spare
neither trouble, time, nor expense to establish Violet’s right; he would
search every church register in London; she should ride in her carriage yet. If
only poor Jason had been alive to rejoice in all this!
</p>

<p>
This was the same man, remember, who not many weeks before had written to
Violet from Stirmingham in the midst of the turmoil of the election, expressing
his deep sense of the responsibility that must of necessity fall upon the owner
of that marvellous city; he would not be that man for worlds. The self-same man
was now intent on nothing less than becoming, through Violet, the very thing he
had said he would not be at any price. Still the same omnipotent circumstances
over which we have no control, and which can alter cases, and change the whole
course of man’s nature.
</p>

<p>
To Broughton he wrote in more businesslike style. He could not help triumphing
a little after the other’s positive prophecy of his failure; he sent him
also a copy of the third edition. But the mass of his letter referred to
Violet’s claim upon the estate, and went as fully into details as he
could possibly do. He referred Mr Broughton to the number and date of the
Barnham newspaper, which contained the advertisement of Arthur Sibbold’s
change of name. Would Mr Broughton take up the case?
</p>

<p>
Who can trace the wonderful processes of the mind, especially when that mind is
excited by unusual events, by unusual indulgence, and by a long previous course
of hard thinking? That evening Aymer treated himself to the theatre, and saw
his beloved Shakespeare performed for the first time. It was
<i>Hamlet</i>—the greatest of all tragedies. Who can tell? It may be that
the intricate course of crime and bloodshed, he had seen displayed upon the
stage, had preternaturally excited him; had caused him to think of such things.
Perhaps the wine he had taken—a small quantity indeed, but almost
unprecedented for him—had quickened his mental powers. Be it what it
might, towards the grey dawn Aymer dreamt a dream—inchoate, wild,
frenzied, horrible, impossible to describe. But he awoke with the drops of cold
perspiration upon his forehead, with a great horror clinging to him, and he
asked himself the question—Who murdered Jason Waldron, true heir to
Stirmingham city? His legal knowledge suggested the immediate reply—Those
who had an interest and a motive so to do. The man who had an interest
was—John Marese Baskette.
</p>

<p>
There was not a shadow of proof, but Aymer rose that morning weighed down with
the firm moral conviction that it was he and no other who had instigated the
deed. He recalled to his mind the circumstances of that mysterious
crime—a crime which had never been even partially cleared up. He thought
of Violet—his Violet—the next heir. Oh, God! if she were taken too.
Should he go down to her at once? No; it was the fancy of his distempered mind.
He would conquer it. She was perfectly safe at The Towers; and yet Marese came
their sometimes. No; where could she be safer than amid that household and
troop of servants? But he wrote and hinted his dark suspicions to her; warned
her to be on her guard. This, he said, he was determined upon—he would
establish her right, and he would punish the murderer of poor Jason. That very
day he had commenced his search among the churches.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Seven.</h3>

<p>
When Aymer’s first and longest letter reached The Towers, together with
the copy of his book, Violet could hardly contain herself with pleasure. His
triumph was her triumph—his fame her fame—and in the excitement of
the moment she but barely skimmed the remainder of his letter, and did not
realise the fact that she was the heiress to the most valuable property in
England. Her faith in Aymer had proved to be well-founded; he had justified her
confidence; his genius had conquered every obstacle. As she had read
Marese’s letters to Agnes, so it was only natural that she should proudly
show this letter to her.
</p>

<p>
Agnes fully sympathised with her, and declared that the sketches (she had
already looked cursorily through the copy of his book which Aymer had sent her)
were wonderfully good. But it was natural for her to be less excited than
Violet, and therefore it was that the second part of the letter made a greater
impression upon her. Violet the heiress of the Stirmingham estate? It was
impossible—a marvel undreamt of. Marese was the heir—there could
not be two—and in Marese she was personally interested. Together they
re-read that portion of Aymer’s letter, and wondered and wondered still
more. His line of argument seemed laid down with remarkable precision, and
there was no escape from his conclusions—but were his premises correct;
was he not mistaken in the identity?
</p>

<p>
The whole thing appeared so strange and <i>bizarre</i>, that Agnes said she
really thought he must be romancing—drawing on his imagination, as he had
in the book she held in her hand.
</p>

<p>
Violet knew not what to think. She could not doubt Aymer. She warmly defended
him, and declared that he was incapable of playing such practical jokes. She
had a faint recollection of poor old Jason once telling her that her
great-grandfather’s name was Sibbold, or something like that—she
could not quite be sure of the name. She remembered it, because Jason had
instanced it as an example of the long periods of time, that may be bridged by
three or four persons’ successive memories. He said that his father had
conversed with this Sibbold, or Sibald, and <i>he</i> again had met in his
youth an old man, who had fought at Culloden in ’45. If it had not been
for that circumstance, the name would have escaped her altogether.
</p>

<p>
The more Agnes thought of it, the more she inclined to the view that Aymer,
overworked and poorly-fed, had become the subject of an hallucination. It was
impossible that Marese could lay open claim to be the heir if this were the
case—perfectly impossible. A gentleman of the highest and most sensitive
honour like Marese, would at once have renounced all thought of the
inheritance; he would have been only eager to make compensation. Why, even
Aymer said that the matter had never been mentioned at the family
council—surely that was in itself sufficient proof. It was an insult to
Marese—to herself—to credit such nonsense. Aymer must be
ill—over-excited.
</p>

<p>
Violet kept silence, with difficulty, from deference to her generous friend;
but she read the letter the third time, and it seemed to her that, whether
mistaken or not, Aymer had given good grounds for his statement. She was
silent, and this irritated Agnes, who had of late been less considerate than
was her wont. It seemed as if some inward struggle had warped her
nature—as if in vigorously, aggressively defending Marese, she was
defending herself.
</p>

<p>
The incident caused a coolness between them—the first that had sprung up
since Violet had been at The Towers. Violet was certainly as free from false
pride as Lady Lechester was eaten up with it; but even she could not help
dreaming over the fascinating idea that she was the heiress of that vast
estate, or at least a part of it. How happy they would be! What books Aymer
could write; what countries they could visit together; what pleasures one
hundredth part of that wealth would enable them to enjoy! Thinking like this,
her mind also became thoroughly saturated with the idea of the Stirmingham
estate. Like a vast whirlpool, that estate seemed to have the power of
gradually attracting to itself atoms floating at an apparently safe distance,
and of engulfing them in the seething waters of contention.
</p>

<p>
In the morning came Aymer’s second letter, imputing the worst of all
crimes to Marese Baskette, or to his instigation.
</p>

<p>
Violet turned pale as she read it. Her lips quivered. All the whole scene
passed again before her eyes—the terrible scene in the dining-room, where
the wedding breakfast was laid out—the pool of blood upon the
carpet—Jason’s head lying helplessly against the back of the
armchair—the ghastly wound, upon the brow. Poor girl! Swift events and
the change of life, and her interest in Agnes, had in a manner chased away the
memory of that gloomy hour. Now it came back to her with full force, and she
reproached herself with a too ready forgetfulness—reproached herself with
neglecting the sacred duty of endeavouring to discover the murderer. To her,
the facts given by Aymer—the interest, the motive—seemed
irresistible. Not for a moment did she question his conclusion. She thought of
Marese as she had seen him for a few hours: she remembered his start as he
heard her name—it was the start of conscious guilt, there was no doubt.
</p>

<p>
A great horror fell upon her—a horror only less great than had fallen
that miserable wedding-day. She had been in the presence of her father’s
murderer—she had eaten at the same table—she had shaken hands with
him. Above the loathing and detestation, the hatred and abhorrence, there rose
a horror—almost a fear. Next to being in the presence of the corpse,
being in the presence of the murderer was most awful. She could not stay at The
Towers—she could not remain, when at any hour he might come, with blood
upon his conscience if not upon his actual hands—the blood of her beloved
and kindly father. A bitter dislike to The Towers fell upon her—a hatred
of the place. It seemed as if she had been entrapped into a position, where she
was compelled to associate with the one person of all others whom love, duty,
religion—all taught her to avoid. She must go—no matter where. She
had a little money—the remnant left after all. Jason’s debts had
been paid—only some fifty pounds, but it was enough. Mr Merton had sent
it to her with a formal note, after the affairs were wound up. At first the
idea occurred to her that she would go back and live at The Place which was
still hers; but no, that could not be—she could not, could not live
there; the spirit of the dead would cry out to her from the very walls. She
would go to some small village where living was cheap; where she could take a
little cottage; where her fifty pounds, and the few pounds she received for the
rent of the meadow at The Place, would keep her—till Aymer succeeded, and
could get her a home. She hesitated to write to him—she half decided to
keep her new address a secret; for she knew that if he understood her purpose
he would deprive himself of necessaries to give her luxuries.
</p>

<p>
That very day she set to work to pack her trunk, pausing at times to ask
herself if she should, or should not, tell Lady Agnes that her lover was a
murderer. Well she knew that Agnes would draw herself up in bitter
scorn—would not deign even to listen to her—and yet it was wrong to
let her go on in the belief that Marese Baskette was the soul of honour.
Clearly it was her duty to warn Agnes of the terrible fate which hung over
her—to warn her from accepting a hand stained with the blood of an
innocent, unoffending man. One course was open to her, and upon that she
finally decided—it was to leave a note for Agnes, enclosing Aymer’s
letter.
</p>

<p>
It was Agnes’ constant practice to go for a drive about three in the
afternoon; Violet usually accompanied her. This day she feigned a headache, and
as soon as the carriage was out of sight sent for the groom, and asked him to
take her to the railway station.
</p>

<p>
The man at once got the dog-cart ready, and in half an hour, with her trunk
behind her, Violet was driving along the road. She would not look
back—she would not take a last glance at that horrible place. The groom,
in a respectful manner, hoped that Miss Waldron was not going to leave
them—she had made herself liked by all the servants at The Towers. She
said she must, and offered him a crown from her slender store. The man lifted
his hat, but refused to take the money.
</p>

<p>
This incident touched her deeply—she had forgotten that, in leaving The
Towers, she might also leave hearts that loved her. The groom wished to stay
and get her ticket, but she dismissed him, anxious that he should not know her
destination. Two hours afterwards she alighted at a little station, or
“road,” as it was called. “Belthrop Road” was two and a
half miles from Belthrop village; but she got a boy to carry her trunk, and
reached the place on foot just before dusk.
</p>

<p>
On the outskirts of Belthrop dwelt an old woman who in her youth had lived at
World’s End, and had carried Violet in her arms many and many a time. She
married, and removed to her husband’s parish, and was now a widow.
</p>

<p>
Astonished beyond measure, but also delighted, the honest old lady jumped at
Violet’s proposal that she should be her lodger. The modest sum per week
which Violet offered seemed in that outlying spot a mine of silver. Hannah Bond
was only afraid lest her humble cottage should be too small—she had
really good furniture for a cottage, having had many presents from the persons
she had nursed, and particularly prided herself upon her feather beds. Here
Violet found an asylum—quiet and retired, and yet not altogether
uncomfortable. Her only fear was lest Aymer should be alarmed, and she tried to
devise some means of assuring him of her safety, without letting him know her
whereabouts.
</p>

<p>
Circumstances over which no one as usual had had any control, made that spring
a memorable one in the quiet annals of Belthrop. The great agricultural
labourers’ movement of the Eastern counties had extended even to this
village; a branch of the Union had been formed, meetings held, and fiery
language indulged in. The delegate despatched to organise the branch, looked
about him for a labourer of some little education to officiate as secretary,
and to receive the monthly contributions from the members.
</p>

<p>
Chance again led him to fix upon poor old Edward Jenkins, the gardener, who
still worked for Mr Albert Herring, doing a man’s labour for a
boy’s pay. The gardener could write and read and cipher; he was a man of
some little intelligence, and, though a new comer, the working men regarded him
as a kind of “scholar.” He was just the very man, for he was a man
with a grievance. He very naturally resented what he considered the harsh
treatment he had met with after so many years faithful service, and he equally
resented the low pay which circumstances compelled him to put up with. Jenkins
became the secretary of the branch, and this did not improve his relations with
Albert Herring. Always a harsh and unjust man, his temper of late had been
aroused by repeated losses—cattle had died, crops gone wrong; above all,
an investment he had made of a thousand pounds of the money that should have
been Violet’s, in some shares that promised well, had turned out an utter
failure. He therefore felt the gradual rise in wages more severely than he
would have done, and was particularly sore against the Union. He abused Jenkins
right and left, and yet did not discharge him, for Jenkins was a cheap machine.
His insults were so coarse and so frequent that the poor old man lost his
temper, and so far forgot himself (as indeed he might very easily do) as to
hope that the Almighty would punish his tormentor, and <i>burn down, his home
over his head</i>.
</p>

<p>
Early in the spring the labourers struck, and the strike extended to Belthrop.
The months passed on, the farmers were in difficulty, and meantime the wretched
labourers were half-starved. Albert was furious, for he could not get his wheat
sown, and upon that crop he depended to meet his engagements. Yet he was the
one of all others, at a meeting which was called, to persuade the farmers to
hold out; and above all he abused Jenkins, the secretary; called him a traitor,
a firebrand, an incendiary. The meeting broke up without result; and it was on
that very evening that Violet arrived. The third evening afterwards she was
suddenly called out by gossiping old Hannah Bond, who rushed in, in a state of
intense excitement—
</p>

<p>
“Farmer Herring’s ricks be all ablaze!”
</p>

<p>
Violet was dragged out by the old woman, and beheld a magnificent, and yet a
sad sight. Eight and thirty ricks, placed in a double row, were on fire. About
half had caught when she came out. As she stood watching, with the glare in the
sky reflected upon her face, she saw the flames run along from one to another,
till the whole rickyard was one mass of roaring fire. The outbuildings, the
stables, and cow-houses, all thatched, caught soon after—finally the
dwelling-house.
</p>

<p>
The farm being situated upon the Downs, the flames and sparks were seen for
miles and miles in the darkness of the night, and the glare in the sky still
farther. The whole countryside turned out in wonder and alarm; hundreds and
hundreds trooped over Down and meadow to the spot. Efforts were made by scores
of willing hands to stay the flames—efforts which seemed ridiculously
futile before that fearful blast; for with the fire there rose a wind caused by
the heated column of air ascending, and the draught was like that of a furnace.
Nothing could have saved the place—not all the engines in London, even
had there been water; and the soil being chalky, and the situation elevated,
there was but one deep well. As it was, no engine reached the spot till long
after the fire was practically over—Barnham engine came in the grey of
the morning, having been raced over the hills fully fifteen miles. By that
time, all that was left of that noble farmhouse and rickyard, was some
two-score heaps of smoking ashes, smouldering and emitting intense heat.
</p>

<p>
Hundreds upon hundreds stood looking on, and among them there moved dark
figures:—policemen—who had hastily gathered together.
</p>

<p>
And where was Albert Herring? Was he ruined? He at that moment recked nothing
of the fire. He was stooping—in a lowly cottage at a little
distance—over the form of his only son, a boy of ten. The family had
easily escaped before the dwelling-house took fire, and were, to all intents
and purposes, safe; but this lad slipped off, as a lad would do, to follow his
father, and watch the flames. A burning beam from one of the outhouses struck
him down. Albert heard a scream; turned, and saw his boy beneath the flaring,
glowing timber. He shrieked—literally shrieked—and tore at the beam
with his scorched hands till the flesh came off.
</p>

<p>
At last the on-lookers lifted the beam. The lad was fearfully burnt—one
whole shoulder seemed injured—and the doctors gave no hope of his life.
(As I cannot return to this matter, it may be as well to state that he did not
die—he recovered slowly, but perfectly.) Yet what must the agony of that
man’s mind have been while the child lay upon the bed in the lowly
cottage? Let the fire roar and hiss, let roof-tree fall and ruin
come—life, flickering life more precious than the whole world—only
save him this one little life.
</p>

<p>
In the morning Albert turned like a wild beast at bay, shouting and crying for
vengeance. “Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord;” but when did man
ever hearken to that? He marked out Jenkins, the gardener; he pointed him out
to all. That was the man—had they not heard him say he hoped Heaven would
burn the farm over his head?
</p>

<p>
That was true; several had heard it. Jenkins had been the last to leave the
premises that night.
</p>

<p>
The gardener, utterly confounded, could not defend himself. The leader of the
Unionists! The police looked grave, and the upshot was he was taken into
custody.
</p>

<p>
Feeling ran high in the neighbourhood, as well it might. There were grievances
on both sides, and the great fire had stirred up all uncharitableness. The
justices’ room was crowded, and a riot was feared. The Union had taken up
poor Jenkins’ defence, and had sent down a shrewd lawyer who put a bold
face on it, but had little hope in his heart. Suspicion was so strong against
the prisoner.
</p>

<p>
His poor old wife was perhaps even more frenzied than she had been at the
coroner’s inquest. Such a circumstance as Violet’s arrival at
Belthrop, though trivial in itself, was, of course, known in the village; she
once again rushed to Violet for help. Violet, though anxious to keep quiet,
could not resist the appeal, she was herself much excited and upset about the
matter. She went with the miserable wife to the Court, and being a lady, was
accommodated with a good seat. Out of her little stock she would have willingly
paid for a lawyer, but that was unnecessary. The counsel retained by the Union
was a clever man; but he could make no head against the unfortunate facts, and
in his anxiety to save the prisoner he made one great mistake—justifiable
perhaps—but a mistake. He asked who would profit by the fire, whose
interest was it? Was not hard cash better than ricks, and an uncertain and
falling market? In a word, he hinted that Albert himself had fired the ricks.
</p>

<p>
A roar of denial rose from the farmers present, a deafening cheer from the
labourers. It was with difficulty that the crowd was silenced, and when the
proceedings were resumed, it was easy to see that the Bench had been annoyed by
this remark.
</p>

<p>
The solicitor on the other side got up, and asked the justices to consider the
previous character of this man the prisoner—who had been on his trial for
murder—was there a single person who would speak to his good character?
</p>

<p>
“Yes,” said Violet, standing up. Amid intense surprise she was
sworn. “My name is Violet Waldron,” she said, nerving herself to
the effort. “I am the daughter of—of—the person who
was—you understand me? I have known this man for years—since I was
a child. He and his served us faithfully for two generations. He is incapable
of such a crime—I believe him innocent—he is a good man, but most
unfortunate.”
</p>

<p>
She could not go further, her courage broke down. They did not cross-examine
her.
</p>

<p>
The prosecution professed great respect for Miss Waldron, whose misfortunes
were well known, but of what value was her testimony in this case? She had not
even seen Jenkins for a long time; circumstances warped the best of natures.
</p>

<p>
The end was, that Jenkins was committed for trial at the assizes within two
months. Thus did circumstances again involve this victim of fate in an iron
net. Here again I must anticipate. Jenkins was sentenced at the assizes to
twelve months imprisonment with hard labour. Nevertheless the imputation
against Albert Herring was never quite forgotten; to this day the poor believe
it, and even the police shake their heads. At all events he profited largely by
it. The corn had been kept in the hope that the markets would rise, but they
had fallen. The insurance-money saved him from irretrievable ruin.
</p>

<p>
The prisoner’s poor wife was reduced to utter beggary. Violet did her
best to keep her, but she could not pay the debts the gardener, with his
miserable pay, had of necessity contracted. Ten pounds still remained unpaid.
At last the poor woman bethought her of an ancient treasure, an old
bible;—would Miss Violet buy it? It really was Violet’s—it
had been lent by Violet’s grandmother to the poor woman, and never
returned. Violet at once remembered Lady Lechester’s fancy for such
books, and recommended her to take it to The Towers. The woman went, and
returned with the money.
</p>

<p>
Now, the immediate effect upon our history of this fire was that Violet Waldron
became a prominent name in the local paper published at Barnham, and that local
paper had been taken for years regularly at The Towers. And at The Towers at
that time Theodore Marese was temporarily staying, under circumstances that
will shortly appear.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Eight.</h3>

<p>
When Lady Lechester returned from her drive and learnt with intense surprise
that Violet was gone, her first thought was that she had been hurt by the
remarks made upon Aymer’s hallucination the previous evening. Agnes
reproached herself for her momentary irritation; but when she found a note for
her from Violet on her dressing-table, and had read both it and the enclosed
letter from Aymer, her anger was thoroughly aroused.
</p>

<p>
Not unnaturally she took it in the worst sense, and looked upon it as a
downright insult. To pretend that a gentlemen of Marese’s position and
character was not the heir that he affirmed himself to be—that he had
wooed her under false pretences—that was bad taste enough, and utterly
unjustifiable. Still, it might have passed as the hallucination of an
over-tasked mind. But to deliberately accuse the same gentleman of the blackest
crime it was possible for human beings to commit, was inexcusable.
</p>

<p>
All the pride of her nature rose up in almost savage resentment. Her first
impulse was to tear up the letters and burn them; but this she refrained from
doing, for on second thoughts they might be instrumental in obtaining the
punishment of the slanderer. It was all the more bitter, because she felt that
she had done her best both for Aymer and Violet, and the latter she had really
loved. Certainly Agnes was far too proud and high-minded to regret for one
moment a single shilling that she had spent for the benefit of others; but the
reflection of Violet’s ingratitude did add a sharper sting. Agnes was in
truth touched in her tenderest place—her pride:—she engaged, or
partially engaged to a pretender, and worse than that, to a murderer—a
Lechester, impossible!
</p>

<p>
Before she had decided what to do, Mr Broughton arrived from Barnham, bringing
with him Aymer’s letter to him. He was utterly unprepared for the mood in
which he found Agnes, and unwittingly added fuel to the fire by saying that he
had searched the file of old newspapers, and found the very advertisement
mentioned by Aymer.
</p>

<p>
Lady Agnes’ indignation knew no bounds. She reproached him for even so
much as daring to investigate the matter—for deeming it possible that
anything of the kind could be. Let him leave the house immediately—she
regretted that she had demeaned herself so much as to admit him to see her.
</p>

<p>
This aroused Mr Broughton—who was not without his professional
pride—and he answered rather smartly, that Lady Lechester seemed to be
forgetting the very dignity to which, she laid claim; and added that if he
should mention Aymer’s discovery to the building society in Stirmingham,
who were his clients, <i>they</i> at least would think Miss Waldron’s
claim one well worth supporting. With this parting shot he bowed and left the
room.
</p>

<p>
No sooner was he gone, than Agnes took up her pen and wrote direct to Marese
Baskette, enclosing Aymer’s second letter—which accused Marese of
being the instigator of the murder—and giving the fullest particulars she
could remember of his first—relating to Violet’s claim. She did not
forget to describe her interview with Mr Broughton, nor to mention his threat
of the building society taking the matter up. She assured him that she looked
upon the matter as a hoax and an insult; and only related the story to him in
order that he might take the proper proceedings to punish the author of the
calumny.
</p>

<p>
This letter reached Marese at his club in London, and, hardened man that he
was, it filled him with well-founded alarm. Till that moment he had believed
that no one on earth was aware of the Waldron claims but himself and Theodore,
who had learnt it from perusal of his father Aurelian’s papers. As for
any one suspecting him of complicity in the death of Jason Waldron, he had
never dreamt that detection was possible.
</p>

<p>
If ever a crime was managed skilfully, that had been; and as to the old story
that “murder will out,” it was of course an exploded superstition.
Had it been Aymer alone who was on his track, he would not so much have cared;
but Aymer had not kept the secret to himself: he had written to a lawyer,
giving his proofs; the lawyer had verified one of them, at least, and Marese
well knew what lawyers were. Then there was the threat of the building society,
just as he was on the point of making a favourable composition with them, and
was actually to receive a surrender of some part of the property in a few
weeks’ time. He appreciated the full force of Broughton’s remark,
repeated by Lady Agnes, that the building society, his client, would be sure to
support Violet Waldron’s claim. Of course they would. A fresh litigation
would be set on foot, and possession of the estate indefinitely delayed; if
that was delayed, his marriage with Lady Lechester would be also thrown back.
</p>

<p>
Yet despite all these serious reflections, Marese would have made comparatively
light of the matter had it not been for the accusation of crime—for the
fact that Aymer had obtained a faint glimpse of the truth. He was not the man
to hesitate one moment at crime, or to regret it after it was done; but he
dreaded detection, as well he might, for from the height to which he had risen,
and was about to rise, his fall would be great indeed. He smiled at Lady
Agnes’ suggestion that he should prosecute Aymer for libel or slander.
Prosecute him in open court, and at once fix ten thousand eyes upon that dark
story; perhaps bring a hundred detectives, eager to hunt out the secrets of a
rich man, upon his track! That would be folly indeed.
</p>

<p>
Aymer must be silenced, and Violet removed; but not like that. The first thing
he did was to telegraph for Theodore, who came up by the express from
Stirmingham.
</p>

<p>
They had a long and anxious consultation. Theodore persuaded Marese to go at
once to The Towers to see Agnes and deny the imputation—to secure her, in
fact. Marese thought that this would hardly do; he knew Agnes better than
Theodore. She would think that he had put himself out unnecessarily, that he
had taken it too greatly to heart, and would simply ask him why he had not at
once instituted legal proceedings against Aymer.
</p>

<p>
In his secret heart of hearts, Marese did not care to visit that neighbourhood
more often than was absolutely necessary. And he really did think that
Agnes’ transcendent pride would be better suited if he treated the matter
in an off-hand way, and dispatched only an agent to represent him—a
species of ambassador. Another reason was that Broughton, if he was on the
watch, would take Marese’s visit to The Towers as a proof that there was
something in it, else why should he be so anxious to deny it?
</p>

<p>
Theodore was willing to go, and he did not long delay his departure. “For
all the time that we waste in thinking,” said Marese, “this fellow,
Malet, is at work. It will take him some time to search all the London
churches; but it may so happen that he may hit upon the very entry he wants at
the first church chance leads him to.”
</p>

<p>
There was no time to be lost. Very probably Aymer himself, of whose whereabouts
in London they were quite ignorant, might go down to The Towers expecting to
see his affianced, Violet. Theodore might meet him there, and—
</p>

<p>
Above all things, Theodore was to so work upon Lady Agnes’ mind as to
turn this apparent disadvantage to a real good, and use it to precipitate the
marriage. Could not she be brought to see that her proudest course would be to
marry Marese, in despite of all these foul calumnies, at once, in defiance? It
would be difficult for Marese to put this himself, but his agent could do so.
</p>

<p>
Theodore went to The Towers, and it fell out much as Marese had foreseen. Agnes
was gratified. Theodore said that Marese looked upon the whole affair with the
deepest contempt, and disdained to proceed. The hallucination of that
unfortunate young man, Aymer, would prove in itself sufficient punishment for
him. Marese desired no vengeance upon a poverty-stricken youth whose brains
were not very clear. Then he delicately hinted at a more immediate marriage,
and saw with satisfaction that Agnes did not resent the idea, but seemed to
ponder over it.
</p>

<p>
But where was Violet? She had left The Towers, and no one there knew her place
of abode.
</p>

<p>
This disturbed Theodore. He wished to know what the enemy was doing; if he
could foresee their designs, then Marese was safe, because they could be
outwitted. It was awkward to have these persons working against them in the
dark—i.e., Violet, Aymer, and Broughton.
</p>

<p>
Violet had left no address. Agnes remembered Aymer’s, but Theodore found
on secret inquiry that he had moved. He waited at The Towers in the hope that
Malet might come. Being a man of versatile talent, and clever in conversation,
Lady Agnes was pleased with him, and invited him to stay as long as was
convenient.
</p>

<p>
While Theodore was at The Towers, the great fire happened at Belthrop, and the
flames were visible from the upper windows of the mansion, where Lady Agnes,
Theodore, and the servants watched them with interest.
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards the Barnham paper was published, with a special account of
the preliminary examination of the supposed incendiary, poor Jenkins, before
the justices, and Theodore came across the name of Violet Waldron. In this way
he learnt that one of the parties, and the most important, was at that moment
living in an obscure village, not much more than fifteen miles distant.
</p>

<p>
He was preparing to pay a visit to Belthrop—ostensibly to see the ruins
of the fire—when Aymer Malet arrived at The Towers.
</p>

<p>
His coming was very natural. He could not understand why he did not hear from
Violet. He had written to her fully twenty times, addressing his letters to The
Towers, and had received no answer. This greatly alarmed him, and he resolved
to go down and see her. All these letters were meantime at the General Post
Office in London.
</p>

<p>
Lady Agnes, determined to cut off every connection with Malet and Violet, had
given the servants strict orders not to take in any letters addressed to either
of them. Aymer’s letters, therefore, went back to the local post office,
and from thence to London, and doubtless in due time they would have returned
to him.
</p>

<p>
When he found himself with seventy pounds in his pocket, he had taken a better
lodging, having previously written to Violet to apprise her of his removal, but
as she never had his letter, her note to him was delivered at the old address,
and Aymer’s old landlady, irritated at his leaving her, coolly put it on
the fire.
</p>

<p>
Violet had only written once, for she too was astonished, and a little hurt,
because Aymer did not write to her, and in addition, she had been much
disturbed by the great fire and the trial of poor Jenkins. The upshot was, that
Aymer leaving his monotonous labour in the London churches, took train and came
down to the nearest station to The Towers.
</p>

<p>
Never doubting his reception, he drove up to the mansion, and was surprised
beyond measure when the servants, respectfully and regretfully, but firmly
announced that Lady Lechester would not see him. Where was Miss Waldron? Miss
Waldron had left—the newspaper said she was at Belthrop, but that was a
day or two ago.
</p>

<p>
Bewildered, and not a little upset, Aymer mechanically turned on his
heel—he had dismissed his fly at the park gates—and set out to walk
to Belthrop. He had almost reached that very little wicket-gate where Lady
Lechester had met the apparition of Cornet De Warren, when he heard a voice
calling his name, and saw a gentleman hastily following him. It was Theodore,
who had requested the servants, and enforced his request by a bribe, to at once
inform him when Mr Malet called.
</p>

<p>
Theodore had a difficult task before him; but he approached it with full
confidence in himself. Without a moment’s delay he introduced himself as
Marese Baskette’s cousin, and at once noted the change that passed over
Aymer’s countenance. Ah!—then Mr Malet was aware of the previous
intimacy that had existed between him and Mr Baskette? That intimacy was now at
an end. He frankly admitted that he had come to The Towers in the interest of
Marese; but upon his arrival he had heard, to his intense surprise, of Mr
Malet’s discovery of the Waldron claim. To him that claim appeared
indisputable: he had written as much to Mr Baskette, and the consequence was a
quarrel. They had parted: and he was now endeavouring to persuade Lady
Lechester to break off her association with that man.
</p>

<p>
He had heard with great interest the career of Mr Malet—he had seen his
book; and while he regretted his misfortunes, he rejoiced that circumstances
enabled him to offer Mr Malet a most lucrative and remunerative post—a
post that would at once give him ease and leisure to promote his literary
labours; which would supply him with funds to continue his researches into the
Waldron claims—and perhaps to bring the guilty to justice; which would
even—this in a delicate manner—it would even permit of an immediate
union with Miss Waldron.
</p>

<p>
Further, as this post was in the city of Stirmingham, Mr Malet would be on the
very spot, and within easy reach of London. The only difficulty was that it
required Mr Malet’s immediate presence in Stirmingham, as it would be
necessary to fill the place at once. Probably from the direction of Mr
Malet’s steps he was on his way to visit Belthrop, and to congratulate
the truly heroic Miss Waldron upon her gallant attempt to save an innocent man
from punishment. At the same time, perhaps, Mr Malet would really serve Miss
Waldron’s interest better by at once proceeding to Stirmingham that very
afternoon with Theodore.
</p>

<p>
What was this post? Mr Malet had been in Stirmingham, and was aware that he
(Theodore) had inherited a very large asylum for the insane there. As he was
himself averse to the science of the mind, he had rarely resided on his
property, but left the chief management to a physician, and the accounts to a
secretary. His secretary had left about a month ago, and the affairs were in
much confusion. He had great pleasure in offering Mr Malet the place. The
salary was seven hundred and fifty pounds per annum, and residence. This
residence was sufficiently large for a married man.
</p>

<p>
Aymer modestly objected that he was hardly fit for so important a trust.
</p>

<p>
Theodore said that he had read his book, and a man who was capable of writing
like that was capable of anything. Besides, he had heard of his ability while
in Mr Broughton’s service.
</p>

<p>
The end was that Aymer accepted the engagement, as indeed he could hardly
refuse it. Still he wished to see Violet. That was certainly unfortunate; but
could not Mr Malet write from the railway station and send it by a messenger.
On arrival in Stirmingham, and taking possession of his place of trust, Mr
Malet could at once write to Miss Waldron to come, and there was plenty of room
at the asylum, and more than one respectable matron residing there with whom
she could remain until the marriage could take place. He was so sorry that Lady
Lechester cherished a prejudice against Mr Malet—that would wear
off—he had done his best to remove it. Still, at present, Mr Malet was
not welcome at The Towers. Would he so far stretch politeness as to stroll
gently on the road to the station? He (Theodore) would speedily overtake him
with a carriage.
</p>

<p>
An hour and a half afterwards Theodore and Aymer were <i>en route</i> to
Stirmingham. Theodore had explained his sudden departure by a telegram. He had
received a telegram, it was true, as he constantly did; but it was as usual a
Stock Exchange report of no importance.
</p>

<p>
From the station Aymer sent a short note to Violet at Belthrop, by special
messenger, acquainting her with his good fortune.
</p>

<p>
They reached Stirmingham the same evening, and next day Aymer was formally
installed in possession of a bundle of papers, ledgers, and account books,
which he was to balance up. He was shown the secretary’s
residence—a fine house, closely adjoining the asylum—and at night
he wrote a glowing letter to Violet, enclosing money to pay her fare
first-class, and begging her to come at once.
</p>

<p>
On the second morning came a note telling him that she should start that very
day, and full of joyful anticipations. She would arrive towards night. Aymer
dined with Theodore, and took wine with him afterwards. Presently he rose to
prepare to go to the railway and meet Violet. He reached his private room with
a singular sensation in the head, a swimming in his eyes, and a dryness of the
tongue. He plunged his face in cold water to recover himself; but it seemed to
increase the disorder. His head seemed to swell to an enormous size, and yet to
grow extremely light, till it felt like an inflated balloon, and seemed as if
it would lift him to the ceiling. Sitting down to try and steady himself, he
fancied that the chair rose in the air, and cried out in alarm. He managed to
pull the bell, and then felt as if he was carried away to an immense distance,
and could look down upon his body in the room beneath.
</p>

<p>
A servant answered the bell, who stared at him, smiled, and
said—“Ah, your fit’s on at last.” Aymer’s last
consciousness was that he was talking very fast, without exactly knowing what
he was saying. After that there was a blank.
</p>

<p>
Meantime Violet was met by Theodore Marese at the railway station; and a
message in cipher flew along the wires to a certain club in London. Marese
Baskette breathed again, for the cipher read—“They are here.”
A simple sentence, but enough.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Nine.</h3>

<p>
A fashionable London newspaper came out one morning with the statement that a
marriage had been arranged in high life, and that preparations were already in
progress. J. Marese Baskette, Esq, of Stirmingham, and Lady Agnes Lechester
were to be shortly united in holy matrimony. This announcement was of the very
greatest value to Marese. Not all the wealth, or reputed wealth he
possessed—not even the honour of representing so important a city, could
obtain for him the position in society which was secured by an alliance with
the blue blood of Lechester. His money affairs wore at once a more roseate
aspect.
</p>

<p>
It was well known that Lady Lechester owned large estates, and they were
naturally reported to be even larger than they were. It was whispered abroad
that, under careful nursing, certain incumbrances had been paid off, and that
the rent-roll was now something extremely heavy even for England, the land of
long rent-rolls.
</p>

<p>
People who had previously fought a little shy of the handsome heir, and asked
hard terms to discount his paper, now pressed forward, and were anxious to
obtrude their services. At the clubs, persons who had affected to ignore the
richest man in the world as a matter of principle, on account of his ignoble
descent, now began to acknowledge his existence, and to extend the tips of
their aristocratic fingers. It was remembered that the doubts and difficulties
which had beset his claim to the vast Stirmingham estate like a dark cloud, had
of late in great part cleared away. The family council had “burst
up,” and there were really no competitors in the field. Marese Baskette,
Esq, in the course of a year or two, so soon as the law affairs could be
settled, would be the richest man in the world.
</p>

<p>
At the clubs they freely discussed his wealth. When realised it would put the
Rothschilds, and Coutts, and Barings, and all the other famous names—the
Astors of New York and even the princes of India—into the shade.
</p>

<p>
Stirmingham, the busiest city in England, surrounded with a triple belt of iron
furnaces, undermined with hundreds of miles of coal galleries, was it possible
to estimate the value of that wonderful place? Why, the estate in the time of
old Sternhold Baskette was roughly put at twenty millions sterling—that
was thirty years ago or more—what must it be worth now? There really was
no calculating it. Suppose he got but one quarter of what he was entitled
to—say property worth only five millions—there was a fine thing.
What on earth had the ladies been thinking of all these years that they had not
secured so rich a prize?
</p>

<p>
Lady Lechester was not a little envied. County families and others, from whom
she had kept aloof for years, overlooked the disrespect, and called upon her
with their congratulations. Invitations poured in upon her; the whole county
talked of nothing else but Lady Lechester’s wedding; even the great fire
was forgotten.
</p>

<p>
In London circles the name of Agnes Lechester, which from long retirement had
almost dropped out of memory, was revived, and the old story of the attachment
to the dragoon and his untimely end in the East, was dug up and sent on its way
from mansion to mansion. It was nothing but pride that made her refuse poor De
Warren who was a handsomer man than Baskette, and came of quite as good a
family as her own. However, fortune seemed to favour these creatures—why,
she must be five-and-thirty; five-and-thirty, ay, closer on forty; older than
Marese—much older.
</p>

<p>
To Agnes, all the conversation that went on around, and the echo of which
reached her, was happiness itself. The intense pride and ambition of her
nature, which had partly kept her in retirement, blazed out in all its native
vigour. Her step was slow and stately; her manner grew cold and haughty; her
conversation distant. When poor old Jenkins’s wife came with the ancient
Bible, she bought it, indeed, and put it on the library table, but barely
looked at it. Six months before she would have criticised it carefully, and
entered a descriptive record of it in the catalogue which she kept with her own
hand. Now it was disdainfully tossed upon one side.
</p>

<p>
A point that was sometimes discussed between these formal and distant lovers
was the place of their future residence, and as Lady Lechester hated The
Towers, and Marese said that the country house near Stirmingham had of late
been closely approached by the coal mines, it was finally settled that they
should reside in a mansion near Regent’s Park, which belonged to Lady
Lechester, until Marese could build a suitable place. This he announced his
intention of doing upon a magnificent scale.
</p>

<p>
It was singular that old Sternhold, whose life was spent in adding stone to
stone and brick to brick, had never contemplated the idea of building himself a
palace.
</p>

<p>
His son determined to surpass all the mansions of England; and the plans, when
once they had been decided upon, were sent down to Lady Lechester for her
approval. They were placed upon a table in the reception room, so that every
visitor who called could not avoid seeing them; and it became one of the
pleasures of Agnes’ daily life to point out the beauties of the new
mansion, and to show her own sketches for improvements. To such littleness did
this once noble and generous nature descend. The Stirmingham estate seemed to
be endowed with the power of degrading every character that came into contact
with it.
</p>

<p>
It was understood that Lady Lechester was to lay the first stone of this grand
mansion when they returned from the wedding trip. They were to go to Italy, and
make excursions in the Mediterranean in Marese’s yacht <i>Gloire de
Dijon</i>, the name of which he now altered to <i>Agnes</i>.
</p>

<p>
Marese’s life at this time was one long continued triumph. The only
danger that had threatened him was crushed; both Aymer and Violet were in safe
keeping.
</p>

<p>
Theodore was still at Stirmingham watching them; perhaps a sterner keeper than
Theodore might turn the key upon one or both ere long. He set his teeth firmly
with a frown as he thought of that possibility. Marese was not the man to be
threatened with impunity. At all events they were quite safe for a good length
of time—till long after his marriage. The marriage once over and he
feared nothing. No scandal could seriously injure him after that. He should be
secured with a triple wall of brass—of wealth, power, position.
</p>

<p>
The property at Stirmingham was falling into his hands like an over-ripe pear.
Let the companies strive how they might, they could no longer discover any
pretext to delay its surrender. The American claimants had vanished into the
distance—that great dread had departed. He had paid off in hard cash a
large share of the claims the building societies made upon him, for expenses
they had incurred in improving the property. He had obtained a rule that the
remainder of the claims should be discharged by instalments; and as now in a
short time he should enjoy almost unlimited credit, there would be no
difficulty in raising the necessary sums.
</p>

<p>
With other societies he had corresponded; with the Corporation he was on the
best of terms, having used his influence in Parliament already to pass a
private bill of theirs, and they had no legal power to prevent his seizure of
his rights. With the rest of his creditors he was not only on good
terms—he was pressed to borrow more. Literally he felt himself, as he
surveyed his monetary affairs, the richest man in the world.
</p>

<p>
Another success came to him. He had delivered his maiden speech in the House,
and whether it really was clever or appropriate, or whether people were
predisposed in his favour, certain it was that it had produced an impression.
The papers were full of it; the reviewers considered it an omen of an
honourable parliamentary career. It was quoted from one end of the kingdom to
the other. His party begun to cast an eye upon him. Here was that rare
combination—a rich man with talent. Could they not turn him to account?
</p>

<p>
Then came the announcement of the engagement with Lechester, and they went a
step further, and said something must be done. Something was forthwith done. An
office was offered to him—not a high office, nor very remunerative, but
still an office; and one only a degree beneath that of a Minister. It was well
understood that no man ever filled that post without subsequently becoming a
Minister. It was a kind of political cadetship. Marese accepted the office, and
wrote to Lady Lechester, who saw in this a new proof of the career in store for
her; and he received in reply the warmest note he had hitherto had.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, he was about to marry into one of the oldest families in England. This
marriage was the sure and certain prelude to a coronet; not that he would take
it till he had exhausted his powers, and felt it time to retire to the House of
Lords. Yet it was this marriage that alone caused any anxiety to Marese. He
grew, for him, nervously anxious as the time approached. It certainly was not
affection for her personally; it was the extraordinary good fortune which now
smiled upon him. Once a gamester—still largely gambling upon the Stock
Exchange—he had imbibed a little of the superstition of the race. Hard as
he was—cool, self-possessed, and equal to any emergency—there arose
in his mind a certain feverish eagerness to get it over; not sufficient to
curtail his rest, or cause him to exhibit any outward sign, or even to diminish
his glory in his success; but there was just this dash of uncertain bitter in
the cup that was rising to his lip. He dared not hurry on the ceremony, knowing
Lady Lechester’s temperament too well: he must await the arrival of the
date that she herself had fixed.
</p>

<p>
There was some little difficulty at The Towers as to where the marriage should
take place. The church at Bury Wick was the natural resort, easiest of access,
and nearest; but Agnes, even in her pride and self-will, could not altogether
make up her mind to be married in that church. The memory of the wedding-party
so strangely and fearfully interrupted there, had not yet died away. It would
seem like a bad omen to be married there.
</p>

<p>
Barnham was so far, and the vicar a Low Churchman, and not to her taste. Marese
suggested Stirmingham: but no, that would not do. My lady would be married from
her own ancestral Towers; and finally hit upon the plan of resuscitating the
ancient family chapel at The Towers, and having the ceremony performed in it.
This could be done by a special licence: which, of course, was no obstacle. It
was true that she disliked and even hated The Towers; but the pride of family
and long descent overcame that feeling. She would be married in the old chapel.
Accordingly, workmen were sent for, and the sound of hammer and plane resounded
through the place. The chapel, disused ever since the Lechesters left the
Church of Rome—about a century ago—was completely renovated,
cleaned, painted, gilded, and adorned in every possible manner.
</p>

<p>
Time flew, and Agnes’ pen was busy in marking the list of names of those
who were eligible to receive an invitation to the marriage. The dresses were
ordered. Agnes was very hard to please—even a simple village maiden likes
to exercise her choice for that once in her life. Judge, then, of the
difficulty of pleasing the mistress of The Towers, soon to be the richest lady
in the world. Nothing was good enough: the orders were countermanded day after
day, and nothing but the enormous sums that were to be expended could have
reconciled the tradesmen to her incessant caprices.
</p>

<p>
Yet through all this loud sound of preparation, through all this silk and
satin, through everything that could be devised to make the heart content,
there penetrated a trouble. Agnes would at times retire to her private room,
and remain secluded for hours. After these solitary fits her step was slower,
and her countenance pale and melancholy, till she gradually recovered herself.
She had broken off her habit of visiting the Kickwell Pot. It had been a great
trial to her to do so; but she had at last firmly made up her mind, and had
conquered the singular fascination which drew her thither. She had decided upon
the earthly career: she would close her eyes to the immortal one. But the
memory of the spirit was not so easily effaced: she mused on its shape, its
graceful, swaying elegance of motion, the glow in its wonderful eyes, and felt
at times the thrill of its electric touch. It required immense strength of mind
to resist the temptation to converse once more with her phantom-lover.
</p>

<p>
Who that had for a moment contemplated the proud and happy position of Lady
Lechester, the observed of all observers, would have credited that such a
hankering, such an extraordinary belief, still possessed her mind?
</p>

<p>
Time flew, and there remained but one brief week till the marriage day. Marese
was to come to The Towers on the morrow, and stay till the day previous to the
ceremony when he was, in obedience to the old etiquette, to sleep at Barnham.
For one day only would she be alone at The Towers. Marese came; the hours flew;
some little warmth infused itself even into their cold intercourse. Just before
dinner he left The Towers for Barnham. After dark, Lady Agnes went out alone,
wrapped in her plaid shawl, and made her way to “The Pot.”
</p>

<p>
The morrow was her wedding-day, yet the old fascination had conquered—she
could not resist it. Once more, for the last time, she would look upon the face
of that glorious being, and beg his forgiveness. It was May now—beautiful
May. The beech trees were covered with foliage, the air was soft and warm, and
there was a delicate odour at times of the hawthorn blossom borne upon the
gentle breeze. Only in places there was a low white mist, a dew hanging like a
light cloud a few feet above the earth. A thin column of such a mist hung over
the mouth of “The Pot,” spectral, ghost-like. There had been heavy
rains previously, and the river was swollen and turbid. Its roar came up in a
sullen hoarse murmur through the narrow tunnel. Over the steep down or cliff
there shone one lucent planet—the evening star.
</p>

<p>
Agnes stole out from among the fern and beech trees, and stood beside the great
decaying oak trunk, leaning lightly against it. Before her but two steps was
the mouth of “The Pot,” and over it hovered the thin mist.
</p>

<p>
The old, old fascination fell upon her, the same half unconsciousness of all
surrounding things. The star grew dim, the roar of the river receded to an
immense distance, and then arose the spirit. What intercourse they had cannot
be told: whether she half yielded to the desire to soar above this earthly
ball, and stepped forward to his embrace—whether she eagerly implored for
pardon for her weakness, dazzled by worldly glory.
</p>

<p>
The dog Dando had followed her unchidden. He alone of all that had pertained to
Aymer and Violet, Agnes had retained. He knew the old path so well. He crouched
so still at the foot of the great oak trunk. So quietly, so heedlessly, taking
no heed of the figure, the shadow that stole onward in the dark beneath the
beech trees—stole forward from trunk to trunk, from bunch of fern to
hawthorn bush.
</p>

<p>
A grey shadow in the form of a man—a crouching, stealthy, gliding
approach—yet the dog Dando made no sign. And Agnes stood with arms
extended almost over the mouth of “The Pot.” And the grey shadow
reached the hollow oak trunk.
</p>

<p>
In the left hand of this shadow was a <i>tin whistle</i>.
</p>

<h3>Ten.</h3>

<p>
After a while, Aymer awoke from the stupor into which the drug that had been
administered to him had thrown his senses. His awakening was more painful than
the first effects of the poison. His head felt as heavy as lead, and there was
a dull pain across his brow. A languid helplessness seemed to possess his
limbs, he could not walk across the room, and with difficulty stretched out his
hand to the bell-rope. Then all the designs upon the wall-papering got mixed up
before his eyes in a fantastic dance, which made him giddy, till he was obliged
to shut them. His consciousness had as yet barely sufficiently returned for him
to notice that he was in a different apartment to any he had hitherto occupied
at the asylum. He must have had partial returns to consciousness previously,
for he found himself sitting in a large armchair, half clad, and wearing a
dressing-gown. A second pull at the bell-rope brought footsteps outside the
door, which sounded heavy upon the boards, evidently uncarpeted. Then a key
turned in the lock outside, at the sound of that Aymer opened his eyes quickly,
and a strong-looking man, whom he had never seen before, peered in.
</p>

<p>
“Where is Mr Theodore?” said Aymer. “Is Miss Waldron come?
Tell them I am better. Ask her to see me. What has been the matter with
me?”
</p>

<p>
“You’ve had one of your fits, sir,” replied the man, very
civilly, but in an indifferent tone.
</p>

<p>
“My fits! I never have fits. Why do you stand in the doorway? Why was the
door locked?”
</p>

<p>
“All right sir—don’t excite yourself. There, you see you
can’t stand. It’s your head, sir, your head.”
</p>

<p>
“Send me a doctor instantly,” said Aymer.
</p>

<p>
“A doctor? He’s been to see you three or four times.”
</p>

<p>
“Three or four times! How long have I been ill, then?”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, five days, I think. Let’s see, you were brought over here on
the Tuesday I remember—yes, five days.”
</p>

<p>
“Brought over here? What do you mean? Who the deuce <i>are</i>
you?” said Aymer, for the first time growing suspicious, and standing up
by dint of effort.
</p>

<p>
“Do sit still, sir, and keep calm, or you’ll have another fit. My
name’s Davidson; I’m a warder; and I’ll take good care of
you, sir, if you’ll only keep quiet.”
</p>

<p>
The truth flashed into Aymer’s mind in an instant.
</p>

<p>
“Do you mean to say I am in the madhouse?” he asked, quietly.
</p>

<p>
“Well, no, sir, not quite so bad as that. This is an asylum, sir.”
</p>

<p>
“How did I get here?”
</p>

<p>
“You were carried over in your fit.”
</p>

<p>
“And where’s Miss Waldron? Tell her to come to me at once.”
</p>

<p>
“There’s no Miss Waldron, sir; your head is not quite clear
yet.”
</p>

<p>
“What! you don’t mean to say that <i>you</i> believe me mad?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, your papers is all right, sir.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer lost his temper, as well he might.
</p>

<p>
“Mr Theodore must be mad,” he said. “Tell him to come at
once; no, I’ll go to him.”
</p>

<p>
With an effort he reached the door; but Davidson easily kept him back with one
hand, in his weak state.
</p>

<p>
“Now do keep quiet, sir—do sit down.”
</p>

<p>
“I tell you I’m the secretary,” said Aymer, his breath coming
fast and thick, for he began to feel that he was trapped.
</p>

<p>
“Ay, ay, sir; they all say that, or something like it. You see, we likes
to get people to come quiet, without any noise. One gent came here thinking it
was his family mansion, and he was a duke. If you’ll sit down, sir,
I’ll get you anything you want.”
</p>

<p>
Poor Aymer was obliged to totter to his chair.
</p>

<p>
“And where’s Violet—where’s Miss Waldron?” he
said.
</p>

<p>
“There isn’t no such person, sir. ’Tis your head;
you’ll be better presently. I’ll look in again by-and-by.”
</p>

<p>
The door shut, the lock turned. Aymer knew that he was a prisoner. For a few
minutes he really was mad, frenzied with unusual passion and indignation, to be
trapped like an animal lured on by provender, and for what purpose? Ah, for
what purpose? Violet—it must be Violet—her claim to the Stirmingham
estate. He was trapped that he might not follow up the clue. Where was she?
Doubtless spirited away somewhere, or perhaps expecting him at Belthrop,
thinking he was coming to her. They would be sure to keep them as far apart as
possible. Theodore was Marese Baskette’s cousin, his friend, his
confidant; he saw it all—he had been drugged, stupefied, made to utter
every species of nonsense, to appear literally mad. He looked round the room;
it was to all appearance an ordinary apartment, except that the door was
strong, and without panels to weaken it. He staggered to the window, he put it
up; there were no bars, no iron rods to prevent him getting out; but he looked
down—a drop of twenty feet—into a narrow, stone-paved courtyard. A
bitter thought entered his mind: they would rather like him to commit suicide
out of that window. Opposite, about ten feet distant, ran an immensely high
stone wall, crenelated on the top, and over that he could catch a glimpse of
the blue May sky. He understood now why the corridor was evidently uncarpeted;
if by any means he should get out at the door, his steps would sound, and give
the alarm at once. He sat down and tried to think; either the excitement, or
the natural strength of his constitution was fast overcoming the poison. His
head was clearer, and he could see distinctly, but his limbs were still feeble.
What could he do?
</p>

<p>
At this moment the key again turned in the lock, and Davidson entered, bearing
a tray with an appetising dinner.
</p>

<p>
“How do I know these things are not drugged also?” said Aymer.
</p>

<p>
“Drugged, sir? That’s always their delusion. Them’s good
victuals. I’ll taste if you like.” And he did so.
</p>

<p>
While his head was turned, Aymer, weak as he was, made a rush at the door. The
warder turned and seized him, and led him back to his chair like a child.
Aymer, mad with passion, threatened him, and snatched at a knife upon the
table.
</p>

<p>
“Ay, ay; steady, sir,” said the warder, quite coolly;
“that’s no use, my waistcoat is padded on purpose. I’ve had
him padded ever since Mr Odo made a stab at me. Now, now, sir, do be quiet;
you’re only a hurting yourself. Eat your dinner and get stronger, and
maybe then you can have a wrestle with me.”
</p>

<p>
He glanced with a half smile at Aymer’s slight, panting figure, and then
at his own sturdy proportions, winked, and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
As his steps died away in the passage, Aymer started to his feet in intense
astonishment. He had heard his own name; he could not believe his
senses—was he really mad?
</p>

<p>
“Aymer Malet, Esq.”
</p>

<p>
The voice was low, but distinct. It might come from the doorway, the window,
the wall, the ceiling. He was startled, but replied—
</p>

<p>
“Yes; I am here.”
</p>

<p>
“Young man,” said the voice, very low, but quite audible,
“take my advice: control your temper. If you stab a warder they will have
a pretext to keep you here all your lifetime.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah,” said Aymer; “thank you, I understand. But who are
you?—who <i>are</i> you?”
</p>

<p>
“I am a young old man. Who are you?”
</p>

<p>
“I am a young man,” said Aymer, growing curious, and for the moment
forgetting his position. “My name you know—I can’t tell how.
I come from World’s End.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah!” said the voice, sadly; “I had hoped you were
sane.”
</p>

<p>
“So I am.”
</p>

<p>
“Why then say you came from the world’s end?”
</p>

<p>
“I did not. I said from World’s End; it is a place near Bury
Wick.”
</p>

<p>
“You are sane then so far. I know <i>that</i> World’s End very
well. I only tried you. I overheard your name when you were carried in. Now,
answer me. Why are you here?”
</p>

<p>
“There, that is what I want to know.”
</p>

<p>
“If you do not know, you are not sane. Cannot you see the motive for your
confinement?”
</p>

<p>
“Certainly I can. It is easy to see that.”
</p>

<p>
And Aymer briefly related the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
“And where is your Violet?”
</p>

<p>
“Doubtless at Belthrop, or spirited away—perhaps abroad. Far enough
from me, at all events.”
</p>

<p>
“Not so: she is in this very place.”
</p>

<p>
“I don’t believe it. They would keep her away.”
</p>

<p>
“I am sure of it. What should you do if you got out?”
</p>

<p>
“I should go straight to Belthrop—or, stay, perhaps I should go to
Mr Broughton. He would protect me.”
</p>

<p>
“Broughton—ah! he is a lawyer. I see you are sane. I must have a
look at you. Turn your face towards the picture of the ‘Last
Supper.’”
</p>

<p>
Wondering and yet curious, Aymer did as he was bid. On the wall above a
side-board was a large copy of Vinci’s “Last Supper.” In a
few seconds the voice came again; and soon he found it came from the picture.
</p>

<p>
“I see you. I have read you. You have talent, perhaps genius; but your
chin is weak. You know not how to fight men. You do not comprehend that men are
beasts, and that it is necessary to be always fighting them. Still you are
sane, you are young—eat, and get strong—you will do. Your name is
familiar to me. Who was your father?”
</p>

<p>
Aymer told him. The voice replied—“I knew him—a clever man,
and, excuse me, a fool. How came you to reside at World’s End?”
</p>

<p>
Aymer told him. “But who are you?” he said, eagerly. “Let me
see you also.”
</p>

<p>
“Very well. Look at the dog under the table in the picture. Now.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer saw a slender white finger suddenly protruded through the body of the
dog.
</p>

<p>
“But I only see your finger.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, that is me. Don’t you know that the hand is the man, and the
claw is the beast? You can see by my finger that I have a hand.”
</p>

<p>
It was evident that the stranger was proud of his white hand and slender
finger.
</p>

<p>
“Who on earth are you?” said Aymer, beginning to get excited.
“If you do not answer me I will pull the picture down.”
</p>

<p>
“If you do, you will ruin us both.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, tell me who you are.”
</p>

<p>
“I am a prisoner like yourself. My name is, or was, for I am dead now,
Fulk Lechester.”
</p>

<p>
“Fulk Lechester—Lady Agnes’ cousin! Ah! I have heard of
you,” said Aymer. “You were very clever, and you went—well, I
mean—”
</p>

<p>
“Ha! ha! ha! I will convince you that I am as sane as
yourself—saner; for what a goose you were to be so easily trapped.”
</p>

<p>
“So I certainly was.”
</p>

<p>
“Would you like to get out? Of course. So should I. Let me see. First, I
have seen you—your physiognomy is good; next, I have read of your book,
for I see the papers; thirdly, I knew your father, at least I knew all about
his career; fourthly, you come from World’s End, and that is my
neighbourhood; fifthly, you are young; sixthly, you are in love, which is a
strong stimulus to exertion. Yes, you will do. Now eat your dinner; you must
get strong.”
</p>

<p>
“I will not touch it till I see you. I will tear the picture down.”
</p>

<p>
“Oh, rash, headstrong! Lift it up instead.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer tried. “I can’t,” he said.
</p>

<p>
“No, because I have fixed it. Now try.”
</p>

<p>
The picture lifted easily, and Aymer was face to face with the stranger. He saw
a little man, a head and a half shorter than himself, elegantly made, and
dressed in the fashion. His brow was very broad and high, his eyes dark and
large, deeply set; his lips perfect. He had a small moustache but no beard or
whiskers. His complexion was the worst part of his appearance; it was almost
yellow. Fulk smiled, and showed good teeth.
</p>

<p>
“I am yellow, I know,” he said. “So would you be if you had
not been out of doors for two years. I look forty, I know; I am really just
thirty-three. Nipped in the bud. Ha! ha! However, there is no time to
waste—the warder will return. Eat your dinner. Let us shake hands.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer readily extended his hand. Suddenly he said—
</p>

<p>
“How do I know that this is not a new trap?”
</p>

<p>
Fulk smiled sadly. “A week ago you believed everybody,” he said;
“now you run to the other extreme. That is youth. I am young; but I am
also old. Trouble makes men old, thought perhaps still older. For seven years I
have done nothing but think.”
</p>

<p>
“For seven years!” echoed Aymer, in horror. “Have you been
here seven years?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes; I was then twenty-six, now I am thirty-three. Ah! I blossomed too
fast. It is a bad sign, friend Aymer, when life is all roses too early; the
frosts are sure to come.”
</p>

<p>
“True,” said Aymer, thinking of his wedding-day, so strangely, so
dreadfully interrupted.
</p>

<p>
“I was a Secretary of State at twenty-six. I had everything—money,
youth, power, a career, a loving wife. A few hours changed it.”
</p>

<p>
“May I ask, how?”
</p>

<p>
“Certainly; companions in misfortune have no secrets. My wife was thrown
from her horse; her beautiful neck was broken. I had no son. We Lechesters are
perhaps a little wild. Odo was certainly wild. Well, grief made me eccentric. I
threw up my career. I was young then, like you. I resigned; I went down to
Cornwall; I built a hut among the rocks, and said I would live a hermit’s
life. I did so. I began to feel better. The sea soothed me; I learnt much from
Nature. You see, I had lived hitherto all my days with men. If I had stayed
there, I should have written something great. But there were men who had their
eyes on me. My property is large, you know; trustees or guardians do not get
pay direct; but there are indirect profits in managing estates. My wife was
dead; her friends did not trouble to protect me. Perhaps I did seem eccentric.
Hermits are out of date. For years it has been the custom to put Lechesters in
an asylum. I was put here; but not so easily as you. I fought; it was no use. I
might as well have been calm.”
</p>

<p>
“And you have been here all these years?”
</p>

<p>
“All these years, but not without trying to escape. I pretended to be
harmlessly mad—quite satisfied with my condition. I was allowed to wander
in the grounds. One day I got up a tree, and before they could follow I was on
the wall, I dropped over but broke my leg. Well, I recovered, but I still limp
a little; after a while, I went into the grounds with a keeper. I tried
cunning. I became harmlessly mad again—my fancy was to fly kites. To one
kite I attached a long letter with an account of my imprisonment. I let it
loose, and it fell in the midst of Stirmingham. But it was no good—it
made a stir—people came here, and I answered their questions calmly. No
good. They were determined to see that I was mad. If I misspelt a single word
in a sentence, it was a proof that a highly-educated mind had partially broken
down. Like you, I got violent—I tried to despatch a warder and get out.
Ever since then I have been in this room.”
</p>

<p>
“Two years?”
</p>

<p>
“Two years. Hush—eat your dinner—Davidson comes.”
</p>

<p>
The picture fell into its place, and Aymer tried to eat the dinner, which had
grown cold.
</p>

<hr />





<h3>Eleven.</h3>

<p>
After Davidson was gone with the tray, Aymer could hear him opening other doors
along the corridor, and waited till all was quiet.
</p>

<p>
“Fulk!”
</p>

<p>
“Aymer!”
</p>

<p>
The picture was lifted, and Fulk’s head appeared in the orifice.
</p>

<p>
“Remember,” he said, “your first object is to get strong;
unless you get strong, neither of us can escape. Therefore, eat and drink, and
above all, sleep. If you fidget yourself, you will waste away. The sooner you
get strong, the sooner you will get out and find your Violet. Push your
armchair up close under this picture, and speak low, lest a warder should steal
along on tiptoe. Take a book in your hand as if reading.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer did as he was told. Fulk’s head receded. “It is difficult for
me to keep long in that position,” he said; “I am not tall enough.
But we can talk just as well.”
</p>

<p>
“How came that hole in the wall?” asked Aymer.
</p>

<p>
“How came your book published?” said Fulk. “By the same
process—patience and perseverance. No credit to me though. When a man is
confined for two years in one room, he is glad enough of something to
do.”
</p>

<p>
“Why did you make such a hole—how did you do it? It was very
clever.”
</p>

<p>
“It was very easy. The poker did a part, the steel to sharpen the dinner
knife did another part!”
</p>

<p>
“But were they not afraid to leave such instruments in your room?”
</p>

<p>
“Not they. Theodore knows very well that I am not mad. He knows that I
have too much mind to attempt suicide. As to the warders, they are strong,
their clothes are impenetrable to an ordinary stab. Besides, I feign to be
harmless, and at last worn out.”
</p>

<p>
“There is no poker in my room,” said Aymer, “and they have
taken the knives away.”
</p>

<p>
“That is because, as yet, they do not know your temperament. They think
they know mine. So far as conveniences, and even luxuries, are concerned,
certainly Theodore does not treat me amiss. I have everything I could have if I
were free—papers, books—everything but tools or liberty—but I
can improvise tools.”
</p>

<p>
“How is it they do not discover this hole in the wall?”
</p>

<p>
“Simply because on your side it is hidden by the picture, and behind the
picture I have preserved the papering. On my side, it is hidden by a mirror;
when I open the aperture, I unscrew the mirror.”
</p>

<p>
“But how did you know there was a picture on this side?”
</p>

<p>
“A person who was confined as you are told me.”
</p>

<p>
“Was he sane then? What became of him?”
</p>

<p>
“Don’t ask me. He was sane. It was a terrible disappointment when
he went.”
</p>

<p>
“But did he not return to get you out?”
</p>

<p>
“You do not comprehend. He lies in the grave. It is my belief—but I
should alarm you.”
</p>

<p>
“They killed him?”
</p>

<p>
“Well, not so violent as that. He died—that is it—before our
arrangements were complete.”
</p>

<p>
“Then you have tried to escape with others?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, three times, and three times accident has baulked it. For that
reason I wish you to get strong speedily, lest you should be removed to another
room—”
</p>

<p>
“Or the grave!”
</p>

<p>
“Let us talk on other subjects. You do not ask how the hole was made, nor
why. I will tell you. In the first place, it was made because I had hopes of
escaping through your room, which was then unoccupied, and the door left open.
That was vain, for it was afterwards occupied; then the hole was enlarged to
let me and one of your predecessors converse, and to let him get into my room,
as you will have to do.”
</p>

<p>
“Why?”
</p>

<p>
“Because your window is a French one; mine has a bar or upright up the
centre, which is an essential element of escape.”
</p>

<p>
“Go on—how did you make the hole?”
</p>

<p>
“With the steel and with the poker—grinding the bricks into dust,
and mingling the dust with the ashes of the fire, so that the warder himself
carried them away.”
</p>

<p>
“And why not escape this way?”
</p>

<p>
“Because, in the first place, the door of that room is kept locked;
secondly, because it opens also into the same corridor, and at the end of that
corridor is the guard-room, where there is always a warder. Your bell rings in
that room.”
</p>

<p>
“How did you learn all these things?”
</p>

<p>
“How did you learn all the little traits of human nature, which the
reviewers say you put in your book? By observation, of course. I had to walk
along that corridor to reach the grounds, when I was allowed to go out.”
</p>

<p>
“But you could bore a hole into the corridor?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, and the bits of broken plaster would tell the story—that
would be simple. Besides, to what end? Once I thought of boring <i>under</i>
the corridor.”
</p>

<p>
“How do that?”
</p>

<p>
“By lifting up one of the planks of the floor here; there is a space
between the flooring and the ceiling, and that corridor has a kind of tunnel
along under it. What for? why the hot-water pipes, to warm the cells, are
carried along it—the cells of the violent, whose rooms have no
fire-grates—that is of no use, for the tunnel at one end comes to the
furnaces, where there is usually a man, neither could I get through the heat.
At the other there is the thick outer wall of stone, and just beneath is
Theodore’s own room—his ears are sharp. Useless, my friend. This
knowledge of the premises seems to you wonderful, simply because you have been
here so short a time. Why, I have never seen the outside of this side of the
building, except a partial glimpse when I was brought, gagged and bound, in a
closed carriage; yet look at this.”
</p>

<p>
He handed to Aymer a sheet of paper, on which was an elevation plan.
</p>

<p>
“I can’t see how you got at this,” said Aymer, beginning to
have a high opinion of the other’s ability.
</p>

<p>
“It was difficult; but patience and observation will accomplish all
things. I learnt much of the outline by the shadow on the ground. Here is
another plan, more minute; this is a ground plan.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer examined it.
</p>

<p>
“Why, you have got even the locks and bolts of the doors,” he said,
in admiration.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I should have made a splendid burglar—what a career
lost!”
</p>

<p>
“But,” said Aymer, “I see here ‘water-canal’
marked. I have seen that canal; why, it runs just outside the high wall just
across the courtyard here.”
</p>

<p>
“Ay, and that is the awkward part of it. First, a narrow courtyard or
chasm to bridge; then a high wall to surmount; then a broad and deep
canal—especially broad here, for, as you will see on the plan, there is a
double width of water for the barges to turn round in. Finally, an unknown maze
of streets.”
</p>

<p>
“Not unknown,” said Aymer. “I can be of some use
there;” and he told Fulk of his residence in Stirmingham during the
family council and the election. He had a fair knowledge of the streets.
</p>

<p>
“That is extremely fortunate,” said Fulk. “You must trace out
a plan for me, in case we should get separated. So you were at the family
council—I read much of it in the papers which they allow me. By-the-by,
Marese Baskette is about to marry my cousin. I wonder she has escaped the
asylum so long—the common fate of us poor Lechesters. Tell me now about
your Violet’s claim.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer did so.
</p>

<p>
Fulk mused a little while.
</p>

<p>
“I begin to see daylight,” he said. “I see much that I did
not previously comprehend. If we only wait, and keep watching, everything comes
plain in time. Waldron—I knew the Waldrons well—very respectable
people, and well descended. Waldron is mentioned in Domesday—Waleran
Venator—i.e., Walron, the Huntsman. Jason Waldron—I wonder if I had
better tell you what I know?—he was murdered, and—but you will not
rest nor eat.”
</p>

<p>
“I shall certainly not eat or sleep unless you tell me.”
</p>

<p>
“Very well, but do keep calm; we shall be out all the sooner, unless
indeed some unforeseen circumstance stops it, as it has hitherto done. <i>Ay di
me</i>!”
</p>

<p>
“Do you know anything of Jason Waldron’s murder?” asked
Aymer, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
“I do; you have yourself told me. I had my suspicions—almost
certainty—before, but I could not see the motive; now I see the
motive—poor, miserable Odo!”
</p>

<p>
“Odo! what has Odo, to do with it? Do go on; I am wild.”
</p>

<p>
“Very well. Odo Lechester murdered your friend Jason Waldron!”
</p>

<p>
“But Odo Lechester is in a lunatic asylum, incurable.”
</p>

<p>
“Odo Lechester was in this very asylum, but he escaped nearly a year ago.
He escaped by permission.”
</p>

<p>
“I am in the dark—explain.”
</p>

<p>
“By permission, directed to destroy Jason Waldron. He had homicidal
tendencies, you know.”
</p>

<p>
“Homicidal tendencies!—escaped! Stay a minute, let me think. I
remember now. Oh! what a fool I have been. Why, I saw the description of him
posted up against the police station in Stirmingham, during the election; it
was partly destroyed—evidently an old bill. I see—I see. But why
should Odo Lechester kill Jason?”
</p>

<p>
“He was instructed to do so. Your dear friend Theodore, who so kindly
offered you a secretaryship at seven hundred and fifty pounds a year, told him
to do so.”
</p>

<p>
“Why—how—how could he—”
</p>

<p>
“Work on Odo’s mind? Easily enough. Poor Odo—he is a beast,
born in the shape of a man: it is not his fault—he is not responsible.
Odo is a tinker and a whistler; he is at home among the gipsies and the woods,
playing on his tin whistle, mending pots and kettles. His three great passions
are tinkering, dogs, and—liberty. Theodore simply assured him that it was
Waldron who was the cause of his confinement. Jason dead, Odo would be for ever
free. Shall I add one more word? If Jason’s daughter were also dead, Odo
would be still safer in his freedom.”
</p>

<p>
“Good God! he may be killing her now. Let me out—help me.”
</p>

<p>
“Silence! Be quiet. She is safe—your cries will ruin all. She is
safe in this very building.”
</p>

<p>
“Impossible—I can’t believe it; it is all a blind. I must go
to Belthrop; I must see Broughton. Good God, how weak I am!”
</p>

<p>
He fell exhausted back into his chair.
</p>

<p>
“How foolish of you!” said Fulk, gently. “But I can
understand it. Now, I will tell you how I learnt all this. It was very simple.
When I found that there was no escape through your room, I tried the other
wall. I removed the clock from the bracket, and bored a small hole. Frequently
I had to stop, because I heard voices. I found the next room to mine was one of
Theodore’s own private apartments: it is the sitting-room, in fact.
Beyond it is his laboratory. I should like to know what is in that laboratory:
if we escape, I <i>will</i> know. He and Marese used to meet here and converse.
I heard them; I listened. I tell you I heard things that would make your flesh
creep. Are you better?”
</p>

<p>
“Yes; oh, that I was stronger! There is wine on the table. Do you think I
might drink it safely?”
</p>

<p>
“Certainly not; but you had better pretend that you have. Pour some
behind the grate; get rid of it somehow, or they will put the poison in your
food. Well, I heard things about a certain ship, the <i>Lucca</i>.”
</p>

<p>
“The <i>Lucca</i>—she was found a derelict.”
</p>

<p>
“Yes, I know; I could tell you how she became a derelict. But Odo. Well,
I heard them discuss that plan. He was to be instructed, and then allowed to
escape. He did escape. I only wish I was strong, and could climb like him. What
he did, you know. If he is still at large, I will wager a hundred pounds I find
him. I know his old haunts. But I could not understand the object
of—of—I see now. Waldron was the descendant of Arthur Sibbold. Are
you superstitious? No. Well, I am—a little. In this case, now, does it
not seem as if the blood of old Will Baskette, shot at the cider barrel, had
revenged itself from generation to generation? Stirmingham was, as it were,
founded with blood. Your poor friend Jason was a descendant of the murderer
Sibbold, who shot the thief; and here is a Baskette continuing the
vendetta.”
</p>

<p>
“For God’s sake, tell me how to escape.”
</p>

<p>
“I will. But is it not Fate? Look at the chain of
events—‘circumstances’ they are called now: the ancients
called them Fate, Sophocles called them Necessity. But you are eager about
escaping. Hush—they are coming!”
</p>

<p>
The picture dropped; Aymer looked down at his book. Davidson entered, and asked
him how he felt. He replied better, and asked if Miss Waldron was in the
asylum?
</p>

<p>
Davidson smiled. “Still on that, sir? I tell you honestly that no such
person is here.”
</p>

<p>
He looked Aymer in the face, and Aymer believed him. Davidson lit the gas, left
several newspapers and books, and retired. So soon as his steps had died away,
the picture was lifted again.
</p>

<p>
“I told you so,” said Aymer; “she is not here. He evidently
spoke the truth.”
</p>

<p>
“He did so—so far as he knew. But this is an immense building; and
you forget—you were not brought here at first—there is a residence,
as they call it, detached. Davidson’s duties never take him there, unless
specially sent for.”
</p>

<p>
“Well, well; let me escape, that is all.”
</p>

<p>
“You have looked out of window; you have seen the courtyard—the
wall. You know that beyond the wall is the canal: all that is plain in your
mind?”
</p>

<p>
“It is. First, we must get across the courtyard, then we must climb the
wall, then descend and swim the canal.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah,” said Fulk, “I cannot swim.”
</p>

<p>
“I can,” said Aymer; “I learnt in the sea.” He
remembered his few bright months of wandering before he had met Violet.
</p>

<p>
“I am glad of it, though I had provided for that. The bladders that would
have supported you, can carry our dry clothes to change.”
</p>

<p>
“The bladders—have you got some to float you?”
</p>

<p>
“I have; but, first of all, the courtyard and the wall. We must not
descend into the courtyard, because at one end there is a
window—Theodore’s window—and he is here now; at the other it
opens on the grounds, and warders are sometimes about. It is the wall we must
attack.”
</p>

<p>
“All we want now is a rope and a grapnel.”
</p>

<p>
“I have a rope and a grapnel. Where? In my bed. What rope? Bell-rope
partly, partly bed cording. How did I get it? By being mad. By picking
everything to pieces with my fingers, as mad people will. They humoured me, and
I secreted half the pieces while they carelessly removed the other. I have a
long, strong rope; long enough to go up the wall and down the other side. I
have also a grapnel.”
</p>

<p>
“That is fortunate. How did you make a grapnel?”
</p>

<p>
“I did not make it; the warder brought it to me. You wonder. But you
noticed the crenelated wall: that is the secret. My grapnel is simply a very
long, strong ruler, such as are used in keeping ledgers, and in some mechanical
drawing; I had it ostensibly for drawing. This ruler must be tied across the
rope; when the rope is flung over the wall, the ruler will catch across the
crenelation. There is the grapnel. The rope at its lower end will be fastened
to the upright pillar, or whatever the technical name may be, which divides my
window into two. There’s the ladder.”
</p>

<p>
“And the swimming bladders?”
</p>

<p>
“I made them out of an old Macintosh, which I also tore up: I sewed them
together. Mad people have whims: one of mine was to mend my own clothes; so I
got needles and thread. They are also in my bed. They have simply to be
inflated with air; they have cords to fasten to the body.”
</p>

<p>
“How clever! I should never have thought of such things. But why did you
not escape before I came? You had all the materials required.”
</p>

<p>
“True—all the means; but not the physical strength, nor the
physical courage. I could not do it without a companion to assist me. You
forget my leg was broken; it is still weak. You forget that I have been
confined without exercise for two years—enough to weaken any man; and I
was never strong. I used to envy Odo as he climbed trees, like the wild man of
the woods he is by nature. Besides, I wanted courage; don’t despise me. I
have moral courage, but I have no physical courage. I jumped from the
wall—yes; but under extreme excitement—this must be done coolly;
and I could not climb the rope. You must climb first, and drag me up by sheer
force.”
</p>

<p>
“I will do it somehow,” said Aymer. “But why not tie loops in
the rope for your feet and hands? Is it long enough?”
</p>

<p>
“Plenty; I never thought of that. Two heads are better than one. I will
do that this very night. How long do you think it will take you to recover
yourself?”
</p>

<p>
“I will try it to-morrow,” said Aymer.
</p>

<p>
“No; that is too soon. Say the night after. We must go as early in the
evening as is compatible with being unseen, so as to have the whole night to
escape in. Now sleep. I shall not say another word.”
</p>

<p>
He withdrew, and Aymer vainly tried to slumber. He could not sleep till
morning, and he did not wake till far into the day. His breakfast was waiting
for him. As he sat down to it with a better appetite, Fulk spoke to him from
the picture.
</p>

<p>
“You look better,” he said; “your long sleep has refreshed
you. Shall we try it to-night? I own I am afraid lest some trifle should delay
us.”
</p>

<p>
“To-night, certainly,” said Aymer. “I feel quite well now. It
was simply a heaviness—a drowsiness—a narcotic, perhaps. Let it be
to-night. I must go to Violet.”
</p>

<p>
“Ah, Violet!” sighed Fulk. “That was my poor wife’s
name too. I shall love your Violet. I will help you. I know more of the world
than you do.”
</p>

<p>
The day passed slowly. They conversed in low tones nearly all the time. Aymer,
led on by Fulk’s gentle ways, frankly told him all his struggles, his
disappointments, his hopes. Fulk was deeply interested. At last he said—
</p>

<p>
“At ten we will do it, or perish. I have a mind,” he said,
“to let you go alone; you are stronger than I am. Very likely my
nervousness or weakness will spoil the whole enterprise; but you could do it
certainly.”
</p>

<p>
“I will not hear of such a thing,” said Aymer; “I will not
attempt it without you. Do you think I am a cur?”
</p>

<p>
The dusk fell gradually—so slowly that it tried Aymer’s patience
terribly. Davidson lit the gas, and left him the evening paper.
</p>

<p>
“Glad to see you getting better, sir,” he said, civilly.
</p>

<p>
He withdrew, and nothing now remained between them and the task except the
twilight. Aymer kept urging to commence. Fulk thought it was not dark enough.
At half-past nine a cloud came over the sky.
</p>

<p>
“<i>Now</i>,” said Fulk; “I have got the rope ready. Take the
picture down, and scramble through the hole. No; hand me your change of dress
first. There is the rope.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer had no difficulty in getting through, and at once picked up the rope. At
one end he found a heavy knob of coal fastened.
</p>

<p>
“That is to throw it up by,” said Fulk, “and to make the rope
hang down the other side. I hid it for that purpose.”
</p>

<p>
Fulk put the window open, shading the gas by the blind. Aymer coiled up the
rope on his left arm to let it run out easily; and was glad now of the physical
education he had unwillingly imbibed at old Martin Brown’s. Many a time
he had cast the cart-line over a tall waggon-load of straw. He looked out,
measured the height, and hurled the knob of coal. It flew straight up into the
air, carrying with it the destinies of two men, like a shot from a mortar over
a ship in distress. A moment of suspense—it cleared the wall, the rope
ran out quickly, till but a few feet were left in Aymer’s hands. Fulk
opened the other half of the window; the rope was passed round the upright and
secured. Next the air-belt had to be fastened under Fulk’s chest and
inflated. Aymer tied his change of clothes and Fulk’s in the other
air-belt, and adjusted them to his back. These incumbrances gave him some
little uneasiness. He pulled at the rope—it was firm; the ruler had
caught the crenelations. Then arose the difficulty as to who should go first;
Aymer, with a lurking suspicion lest Fulk’s heart should fail, compelled
him to take the lead. He helped him at the window, and saw a new danger. Their
shadows were projected on the wall opposite; if any one looked that way it
would be seen in an instant that something was going forward. Below on the
right was a bow window, and from this bow window a stream of light fell upon
the rope. However it was too late to hesitate.
</p>

<p>
Folk clung like a cat till he got his foot into the first loop, then he went up
fairly well. As soon as he was up, and Aymer could see his form dimly astride
of the wall, he followed. Halfway up, as he looked down, he saw a man in the
bow window approach and draw down the blind. If he had looked out he must have
seen the rope and Aymer, but he did not. When the blinds were down the rope
became invisible. With a beating heart Aymer found himself at the top of the
wall, astride, facing Fulk, who pressed his hand.
</p>

<p>
“I feel all right now we have started,” he whispered; “I
think I shall manage it yet.”
</p>

<p>
There were no loops for the descent. Aymer, after one glance at the city lights
before him, slid down first, and let himself into the water gently. He adjusted
the load on his back on the float: then shook the line as a signal to Fulk, who
came halfway down well, but his nervous excitement overcame him, and he rather
fell than slid the remainder, reaching the water with a splash. His head did
not go under, but they feared lest any one had heard it. In a few seconds, as
all was quiet, Aymer struck out, pushing the float in front and dragging Fulk
behind. He had no load to support, but simply to force his way through the
water. It was chilly, but not so cold as he had feared. It smelt
unpleasant—some chemical works discharged into it. Though a fairly good
swimmer, Aymer had a hard struggle to cross the broad canal, and more than once
paused to recover his strength. At last they landed on the towing path, and
without a moment’s delay got over a low wall into some back garden and
changed their clothes, wrapping the wet things round a loose brick from the
wall and dropping them in the water. They then made haste along the towing
path, Aymer leading, and emerged at a bridge into a broad thoroughfare, gaslit
but deserted.
</p>

<p>
“Come on,” whispered Aymer. “There is the station; we shall
catch the up 10:15 train to London.”
</p>

<p>
“Is that the station?” said Fulk. “Then here we part.
Good-by.”
</p>

<p>
“Part? What do you mean?”
</p>

<p>
“I mean this: that I owe you my liberty—I shall repay you. I shall
stay here and watch for your Violet—I am sure she is here.”
</p>

<p>
It was useless arguing with him: Fulk was determined.
</p>

<p>
“I shall easily hide in this great city,” he said. “We shall
be on the watch in two places at once—you at Belthrop and World’s
End, and I here. Make haste. By-the-by, can you lend me a pound or two? I have
no money with me.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer insisted upon dividing the sixty-five pounds he had left. Then they shook
hands.
</p>

<p>
“Stay,” said Fulk, “our rendezvous?—Where shall we meet
again? Quick!—your train.”
</p>

<p>
“At The Place, World’s End,” said Aymer at a venture, and
with one more rapid handshake ran off. He caught his train, and by one in the
morning was in London.
</p>

<p>
Poor Fulk, wandering he hardly knew where on the look out for a quiet inn, came
suddenly into a crowded street, and amidst a number of carriages evidently
waiting. He looked up—it was some theatre or other. There was a large
poster announcing that the famous singer Mademoiselle F—o would perform
that evening in the Sternhold Hall, and as he read, he heard a loud encore
which reached even to the street.
</p>

<p>
“I remember her,” he thought. “I saw her at Vienna the year
before I was captured. They said she was this Marese Baskette’s
mistress—a splendid creature. I’ve half a mind—I
haven’t heard a song for so long—”
</p>

<p>
He hesitated. Prudence told him to go away; but talk of prudence to a man who
has just escaped into liberty! He walked in; the performance was nearly over,
but he paid and went into the pit. “After all,” he tried to
persuade himself, “there’s more safety in a crowd. When I go out, I
can take a cab and drive to an hotel and say I’ve lost my train through
the theatre; that will account for my having no luggage.”
</p>

<p>
As he struggled in among the crowd, he glanced up at the boxes; his pushing
caused a little movement, and people in the boxes looked down. He caught an eye
watching him—he turned pale. It was Theodore, who rose at once and left
his box. Poor Fulk gasped for breath; he pushed to get out. The audience was
annoyed at the movement and disturbance—some gentlemen held him
down—the notes of the singer’s voice floated over, musically sweet.
Poor Fulk!
</p>

<h3>Twelve.</h3>

<p>
Science, as illustrated by the printing press, the telegraph, the railway, is a
double-edged sword. At the same moment that it puts an enormous power in the
hands of the good man, it also offers an equal advantage to the evil disposed.
</p>

<p>
Theodore Marese was a man of science; and he was a typical man of
science—hard, clear, bright, pitiless as the dissecting knife.
Unfortunately, he applied his knowledge and his undoubted ability to the worst
of uses. One pursuit to which he had devoted special effort, and over which he
had spent many thoughtful hours, was the problem how to dispose of a dead human
body. There was an old superstitious saying that the earth will not hide
blood—it will out. Theodore was of a different opinion. Science had
conquered everything: science could conquer this. Yet it certainly was a
difficult task. Did you ever contemplate the difficulty? Suppose you slay your
enemy—slay him secretly, effectually: now, what next? Try to bury it: the
loose earth speaks for itself. Exhalations will rise. Quicklime it, and hasten
its decomposition: there will remain, perhaps, only a brass button, or some
coin left in the pocket. Throw it into the water: it will rise to the surface.
Burn it, and all the city will know from the odour. The more you think over it,
the more difficult it will appear. But Theodore had found the solution.
</p>

<p>
In that laboratory of his which Fulk wished to explore, and which was a
harmless-looking room—without so much as a phial or a microscope in view,
there was at one corner, not very far from the fireplace, a long upright
cupboard, reaching from the floor to the ceiling. Or, rather, the cupboard rose
about halfway, and a bookcase reached the remainder. It was a shallow cupboard.
There were no locks to the doors. Any one could pull them open, and see a few
trifles within—such trifles as might be found in any bachelor’s
room. The bookcase was also shallow, but there was depth enough back for some
rows of books. The books were harmless enough—mostly medical works, just
such works as any one can purchase who cares to. Nothing certainly here to
excite suspicion. Yet behind that cupboard and bookcase was concealed the most
deadly, insidious, awful engine ever constructed by man—an engine about
which no secrecy exists either, and which living men have seen in operation;
which has been described in the papers; and which the legislature must put
down, or strictly regulate.
</p>

<p>
Upon removing one of the books, Theodore had merely to push aside a small brass
plate, which looked like part of a hinge, and there was a keyhole; turn the
key, and the whole cupboard swung bodily out into the room. It was, in fact, a
blind, placed in front of a narrow inner door, which rose to the ceiling. When
the door was open, there stood revealed an iron box, not unlike an extremely
long coffin, placed on end. There was a keyhole—two key-holes—to
this iron box. Open the first, and there was a large cavity, tall enough for a
man to sit on a bar which went across it, without his head touching the iron
roof. In this iron roof there was an opening, not unlike a small grating. Put
the key in the second keyhole, above the first, and there was the apparatus,
greatly improved by Theodore, but in substance the same as used in other
places—the apparatus for absorbing the smell of the gases which arise
from a human body when consumed by heat. Every one knows that if the smoke of a
pipe be passed through water in a peculiar way, it loses its pungency, and you
can inhale it with more comfort: this is the hookah. Everybody also knows that
manufacturers in great towns are compelled to consume their own smoke, and all
have seen a lump of loaf sugar suck up a spoonful of tea. A combination of
these principles formed Theodore’s deadly engine, which was nothing more
or less than a private cremation stove. The ordinary fire in the
harmless-looking fireplace produced sufficient heat, when a draught was caused
by turning a winch with a multiplying wheel placed at the lower part of the
cupboard, just beneath the cavity which was to receive the body. This body,
made thoroughly insensible and unconscious by being saturated with chloroform
or strong drugs—or, if you like, still more insensible with a trifle of
arsenic—had merely to be lifted into its iron coffin, the door closed,
the blast applied, and in a couple of hours or so there would remain a little
heap of ashes, and a little melted metal, brass buttons, coins, and such like,
things easily dropped into a canal, dust easily mixed with the ashes under the
grate. Now, where was all that superstitious nonsense about the difficulty of
getting rid of a dead body?
</p>

<p>
Whether Theodore had ever used this awful engine was never known; but it
existed, and it may exist at this present hour in other equally unsuspected
places. What I say is, that the legislature should take cremation in hand. If
any one had been shut up in that iron box alive—only stupefied for a few
minutes with a drug, put in asleep; if they had been awakened by the red-hot
iron, of what use would their screams have been—deadened by the
confinement, deadened by thick walls?
</p>

<p>
“I am extremely sorry,” said Theodore Marese, meeting Violet at the
railway station, and handing her to a carriage; “I regret very much that
Mr Malet could not come. He has, in fact, gone upon a special mission. A
gentleman in the Isle of Man, who owed us a large sum, died suddenly; his
affairs are in confusion, and Mr Malet was obliged to start this afternoon to
see to our debt. I am the bearer of his regrets. At all events, he will not be
absent more than a week.”
</p>

<p>
Violet was naturally much disappointed, but after all, it was only a week or
ten days, and they treated her with great courtesy at the residence at the
asylum. A matron was always ready to afford her companionship; no intrusion was
made upon her privacy. Theodore occasionally called upon her in the most
respectful way. Books, papers, anything she seemed to wish for came at once.
The matron, a lady-like person, took her into the town to do some shopping.
Everything but a letter from Aymer. However, that was easily
explained—the sea-post was always uncertain. Theodore took her over a
great part of the asylum; she was astonished at its size, and the number of its
inmates. It saddened her, and she still more longed for Aymer to return.
</p>

<p>
Why it was that she was not confined like Aymer was never wholly explained, but
there is some reason to think that Marese Baskette had a faint idea of marrying
her himself. He was, as we have seen, nervous about his marriage with Lady
Lechester: lest anything should happen to prevent or delay it. This girl,
Violet, he well knew, had a good claim to the estate; suppose he married her?
She was a second string to his bow. As to the rumour of his being her
father’s murderer, he would trust to his own wit and handsome face to
overcome that. He never questioned his power to have her if he chose—but
Lady Lechester first. Theodore had therefore his instructions to treat her
well, and give her seeming liberty, and above all to keep her in good temper.
Theodore did as he was bid. This seems the natural solution of the problem. If
she had known that Aymer was so near!
</p>

<p>
It happened at this time that, on the seventh day after Violet’s arrival,
the famous singer, Mademoiselle F—o, of whom all the world was talking,
was to sing for one night only in the Sternhold Hall. Theodore, finding that
she was getting restless and thoughtful, seized upon this opportunity to while
away her gloom. He proposed that she should accompany him to the theatre or
hall, and Violet, who had never heard an opera in her life, was naturally
enough delighted to go. They went, and as it chanced it was the very night that
Aymer and poor Fulk chose to make their escape. Thus it was that
Theodore’s eye caught sight of Fulk, the moment the commotion caused by
his late entrance attracted his attention. Violet was extremely pleased; the
notes of the music and song filled her with an exquisite enjoyment. She was
very beautiful, leaning over the front of her box, and scores of glasses were
directed at her. Had she known that at that very moment Aymer was risking his
life to escape!
</p>

<p>
The difficulty in this history-writing is to describe two or three events at
the same moment. The eye can only read one line at a time, how then are you to
bring two scenes at once before it? Some allowance must be made for the
infirmities of the pen. There were two scenes proceeding at the moment that
Theodore’s eye fell upon Fulk—three scenes, if you reckon the opera
on the stage. First, poor Fulk shivering with terror, struggling to escape, the
crowd round execrating him, his mind in a whirl, reproaching himself with his
folly, and the tall figure of Theodore, who had come down from the box,
pointing him out to an attendant and pushing forward to seize him. On the
stage, La Sonnambula was uttering her sweetest trill; Marese Baskette’s
mistress in the full height of her glory, with hundreds upon hundreds of the
élite of that great city intent upon her every accent—hundreds
upon hundreds of well-dressed, fashionable, wealthy ladies and gentlemen, most
of whom knew her connection with Marese, the popular M.P., were there. This
very knowledge attracted them in shoals. This was scene two.
</p>

<p>
The third scene was underneath. There in the darkness and gloom of the cellars,
amid the slimy pools of water, the hideous fungi, the loathsome toads and
creeping things, the grey sewer-rats were at work. You have seen a ship
launched—she stands firm as a rock till the last wedge is knocked away,
then glides into the water. Something of the same kind was going on here
beneath the feet of several hundred human beings. These musty cellars and
vaults under the Sternhold Hall, with their awkward approach, had been let at
last. A London firm had given a small sum for them, and established a store of
whisky casks. A dozen or so of whisky casks had been rolled down, a name put
upon the door, and an advertisement in the newspaper. Nobody could do business
with this firm, their terms were too high. The whisky casks, in truth,
contained pure spring water. It was an excuse, however, for men in rough
jackets, who had evidently been at work, to go in and out of these vaults, and
to take with them saws and chisels, hammers, and other harmless tools. The firm
was, in fact, composed of a dozen or more of the sharpest sewer-rats in
Stirmingham. Their little game was so delightfully simple—only a little
gnawing to be done! When Theodore and Baskette went down into this place, they
found the floor supported by timber pillars. Their idea was to blow it up. The
sewer-rats were much cleverer—their idea was to saw through the wooden
pillars, and let the roof or floor down, and with it many hundred shrieking,
maimed, and mutilated human beings. How simple great ideas appear when once
they are described! There is nothing novel in the idea either: the holy Saint
Dunstan tried it at Calne, and found it answer admirably.
</p>

Some say odd accidents have happened to grand stands at race meetings, through
iron bolts being inadvertently removed. When hundreds of well-dressed,
fashionable people, ladies and gentlemen, with gold rings and diamonds,
earrings and bracelets, watches, money, bank-notes, and similar valuables about
them, not to mention rich cloaks and perhaps furs, were shrieking, struggling,
groaning, maimed, mutilated, and broken to pieces, with jagged ends and
splinters of deal sticking into their bodies, how nice and benevolent it would
be to go in among and assist them; to lift up the broken arm, and lighten it of
the massive gold bracelet; to pull the horrid splinter out of the leg, and
extract the well-filled purse; to alleviate the agony of the bruised shoulder
or the broken back, and remove the choice fur or necklace of diamonds!
Thoughtful of the sewer-rats to provide this banquet of Christian charity!
</p>

<p>
The one difficulty had been to get the several hundred people there. They had
all in readiness for months, watching. They had it ready while the family
council sat, and had deliberated about knocking the last wedge out at that
time, but on reflection it was doubtful whether the Americans had much coin
about them. Finally, one shrewd sewer-rat hit upon the idea of engaging
Mademoiselle F—o to come down and sing. They paid her one hundred pounds
in advance, with travelling expenses to come afterwards; and it would have been
a good speculation in itself, for they took three hundred and fifty pounds,
including the boxes. These boxes were a worry. They could not be let down, they
were not built on wooden pillars; however, it was easy to shut one of the
folding-doors at the entrance, and let the bolt drop into the stone—easy
to raise a cry of “Fire!”—easy to imagine the crush at the
door.
</p>

<p>
Easy also for me to enter into a catalogue of broken limbs, ribs, fractures,
contusions, gashes, etc, etc—I shall leave it to the surgical
imagination. But when hundreds of people, closely packed, are suddenly
precipitated eighteen feet, amid splintering planks and crushing beams, it is
probable that the hospitals will be full. This was the third scene preparing
underneath.
</p>

<p>
Just as Fulk felt Theodore close to him—just as F—o uttered her
sweetest trill—just as Violet was in the height of her
enjoyment—the grey rat gave his last nibble—the last wedge was
knocked away; and the floor went down. Poor Violet saw it all. She saw fourteen
hundred hands suddenly thrown up into the air; she heard one awful cry, she
felt the box tremble and vibrate, and the whole audience sank—sank as
into one great pit. She turned deadly pale; she clung with both hands to the
balustrade; but she did not faint. It was all too quick.
</p>

<p>
Fulk was in a stooping position, struggling to escape. That saved him. He fell
with his body across a joist, which with a few others had not been
sawn—some few had to be left to keep the floor apparently safe. His arms
flew out in front, his legs struggling behind; he was poised on the centre of
his body. At any other time one might have laughed. In that terrible moment the
instinctive love of life endowed him with unusual strength. He knew not how he
did it, but he got astride of the joist; he worked himself along it; he reached
one of the slender iron columns or shafts which supported the boxes and
gallery. He who mistrusted his power to climb a rope, in that hour of horrors
went up that shaft with ease, assisted by the scroll-work on it. He got into
the very box where Violet sat, with straining eyes gazing into that bottomless
pit. Exhausted, he fell on his knees beside her. Exhausted, he heard the cry of
“Fire!”—heard the rush to the doors. He remained on his
knees, gazing, like her, down into the pit.
</p>

<p>
The cry that rose up—the shouts, the groans, the shrieks—will ring
in Fulk’s ears till his death. Violet never heard a sound; her whole
faculties were concentrated in her eyes. Heaps of human beings striving,
heaving; fragments of dresses, opera cloaks fluttering from joists in mid-air;
splinters with pieces of torn coats—Ah! I cannot write it; and she dares
not tell me. One dares not dwell on this scene. One more word only. Fulk
glanced at the stage: still the lights burnt there; the painted scene was
untouched; the singer, F—o, had fled by the stage staircase.
</p>

<p>
It is odd, but the idea since came to me—she was the cheese; the hall,
the trap. The simile will hardly bear close investigation.
</p>

<p>
It was those few minutes that Fulk and Violet spent in motionless horror that
saved them. They thereby escaped the crush at the door; that is to say, they
escaped being in it; it was impossible to go out without seeing it. Fulk
recovered himself a little: his first instinct was that of a
gentleman—the lady beside him. He caught her arm, and dragged her up from
her seat; and she came with him unresistingly out of the box into the corridor:
he could feel her whole frame tremble. Perhaps, reasoning after the event, they
might as well have sat still; but remember the awful cry of fire, the
instinctive desire to escape, and that Fulk was still fearful of being
re-captured! They reached the staircase—descended it to within a few feet
of the passage. There they saw a black mass, writhing, heaving: it was a mass
of men and women who had fallen, and been trodden down. It extended along the
whole passage to the open air. Then Violet fainted, and hung in his arms inert,
helpless. Poor girl! it was enough to unnerve the boldest man. Fulk grasped her
round the waist—he was short remember—he struggled with her; got
his feet on that awful floor of moving bodies; he stumbled, and staggered
towards the air, gasping for breath, dragging, half-trailing her behind him. He
cried for help—his arms failed him; his poor, weak leg—the one that
had been broken—slipped down into a crevice between two fallen men, and
strive how he would he could not get it out. A mist swam before his eyes; but
he did not let go—gallant little Fulk!
</p>

<p>
Strong arms seized him. Cabmen, police, coachmen, grooms—idlers who had
rushed to the doors—seized him, and pulled him out, and set him on his
legs, and pushed the brandy flask between his teeth. And still Fulk
instinctively held tight to his burden.
</p>

<p>
“Where shall I drive you, sir?” said one cabman.
</p>

<p>
“To—I don’t know. Where is a good hotel?”
</p>

<p>
“The ‘Dragon,’ sir.”
</p>

<p>
“Help to lift her in.”
</p>

<p>
Fifteen minutes afterwards they were at the “Dragon.” Fortunate,
indeed; for all the city—the great city—was pouring in vast crowds
to that horrible doorway; and those who were extricated found it difficult to
get away.
</p>

<p>
Fulk and Violet were well cared for at the “Dragon,” as, indeed,
they would be after so terrible a catastrophe had brought out all the sympathy
there was latent in that city. Besides, they were well-dressed, and Fulk was
found to have money in his pocket-money, to do them justice, not one farthing
of which was touched while he and Violet lay in adjoining rooms
helpless—for they were helpless, utterly exhausted for six whole days.
When Fulk, conscious that he must be stirring, did pull himself together and
got out of bed, and into the sitting apartment, the first thing he saw was a
newspaper on the table, the <i>Stirmingham Daily News</i>, which had come out
with a deep line of black round every page, and in which was a list of the dead
and wounded; the killed were very few in proportion to the injured. Fulk looked
for Theodore Marese; he found his name among the dead. Theodore was gone to his
account; he had been found on the floor of the vault face downwards, quite
dead. There was a deep wound in his forehead, and it was thought that, in
falling, his head had struck the iron-bound edge of one of the supposed whisky
casks.
</p>

<p>
Violet, when she heard that Fulk was up, came out of her room and held out her
hand. She was still dreadfully pale; but Fulk thought he had never seen a more
beautiful face. She thanked him with tears in her eyes; and Fulk in vain tried
to make her think that he had done nothing. “I was up yesterday,”
she said, “but I could not go till you were better. Now, will you please
take me back to the asylum?”
</p>

<p>
“The asylum?” said Fulk, in amazement.
</p>

<p>
“Yes; Mr Theodore will be anxious about me. I sent a message yesterday to
him, but I have had no reply.”
</p>

<p>
“Theodore Marese is dead,” said Fulk, quietly. “I trust you
have had nothing to do with him?”
</p>

<p>
“Dead!” Violet shuddered. “But I must go to the asylum;
perhaps Aymer has returned.”
</p>

<p>
“Aymer—what Aymer?”
</p>

<p>
An explanation followed, which will be readily understood. It was long before
Violet could believe him; till at last his reiterated statements, and the
little incidents he related, shook her incredulity. Even then she was partially
doubtful, till Fulk chanced to look at the paper on the table. There was an
advertisement in large type—“Escaped from the Asylum, Fulk
Lechester and Aymer Malet.” She could no longer doubt.
</p>

<p>
“How miserably I have been deceived,” she said, and burst into
tears.
</p>

<p>
Fulk was greatly shocked.
</p>

<p>
“You see now that I must hasten away,” he said. “Doubtless
this great catastrophe has occupied men’s minds, and interfered to
prevent a strict search; but now I have found you it is a folly to remain here.
My rendezvous with Aymer is at The Place, World’s End. We will go to
World’s End at once.”
</p>

<p>
“Aymer will be there?” said Violet, brightening a little.
</p>

<p>
“Yes, Aymer will be there,” said Fulk.
</p>

<p>
That evening they paid the bill—to the honour of the
“Dragon,” it was a very small one—and reached the station in
a fly. The same train that had taken Aymer to London took them also. They
stayed that night at an hotel, and next afternoon travelled down to the little
station nearest to World’s End. Another fly took them to the outskirts of
Bury Wick village; and from thence they walked to The Place. Violet’s
heart sank; it was dark, not a light in the window, not a sign of life; the
doors were fast. They broke a pane of glass, and Fulk opened the window, got
in, and unbolted one of the back doors. Fulk had taken the precaution to bring
with him a few provisions, and had also bought the local paper—<i>The
Barnham Chronicle</i>—and stuffed it in with the ham in the basket, for
he was anxious to read about his cousin Lady Agnes’ marriage. Violet made
a fire, and got some tea: she had provided that. Where was Aymer?
</p>

<p>
A strange night that at The Place. Fulk felt safer now he was out of the city:
but Violet had too vivid a memory of the past. In the very house where so many
happy hours had been passed she was alone with a perfect stranger, or one who
was a stranger but a little while before. And Aymer?
</p>

<p>
“Where could Aymer be?” was the question she constantly asked.
</p>

<p>
Fulk said, “Aymer was doubtless at Belthrop, trying to find her.”
</p>

<p>
“But Hannah Bond knows I started for Stirmingham,” objected Violet.
“If Aymer should see her, and go back to Stirmingham. I must write to
her—or will you?”
</p>

<p>
“I will go and see her,” said Fulk; “certainly I will. But
remember that I am in hiding; it must be at night. Wait till to-morrow night.
Give Aymer that little time to come, then I will go.”
</p>

<p>
“Hannah must come and live here with me,” said Violet, musingly.
“I think I shall stay at The Place till—till—where is your
newspaper?”
</p>

<p>
“I—I—burnt it,” said Fulk. “I burnt it helping
you to light the fire.”
</p>

<p>
It was the truth, yet it was a lie. He had burnt it, that Violet might not see
something in it. Aymer was not at Belthrop. Aymer’s name was in the
paper.
</p>

<p>
“How shall I amuse you?” said Violet. “This is my home; I
must amuse you. I will play to you one of the airs that Aymer likes. Poor
Aymer!” she added, half to herself.
</p>

<p>
The gentle, melancholy music of Mendelssohn filled the room from the long
unused piano.
</p>

<p>
“Poor Aymer!” repeated Fulk to himself. Poor Aymer, indeed!
</p>

<h3>Thirteen.</h3>

<p>
At twelve o’clock of the night before his wedding-day, Marese Baskette
was galloping, fast as his best thorough-bred could carry him, from Barnham
town to The Towers. Barely had he settled himself at his hotel to think over
the coming day, than a message summoned him to return. It was a splendid
night—warm, still, the sky full of stars, and a faint odour of the
hawthorn blossom in the air. The thin mist that Lady Lechester had seen had
descended into the hollows, and as Marese rode through it, it reached to his
saddle-bow. The horse rushed on, hidden in the cloud that covered the earth;
the rider sat above it. Far behind clattered the groom, who had fetched him in
hot haste.
</p>

<p>
“Lady Lechester is lost!” Such was his brief message, and not all
Marese’s sharp questioning could elicit anything more, for the simple
reason that nothing more was known. About eight o’clock she had been seen
to leave the house, and the servants took no particular notice of it, expecting
her to return in a short time, as she usually did. As she usually did
I—this was the first time Marese had heard of the nocturnal walks of his
bride. It was a mystery to him: it angered him. A man of plots and stratagems,
he was always more or less suspicious of others. An hour had passed, and Lady
Lechester did not return. The guests—and they were numerous that night at
The Towers—asked for her; the household still kept their mistress’s
secret, but two ventured out to seek her. They went to the well-known spot,
they saw the oak trunk, they heard the roar of the river—but Lady
Lechester was not there. An anxious consultation took place; butler, footmen,
the upper servants held a whispered discussion. At last the gamekeeper was sent
for: if Lady Lechester happened to see him, she would not be annoyed; if she
met any of the others, and fancied they had been watching her, it would cost
them their places. The guests were put off with various excuses. Time passed:
the gamekeeper reported the park clear, and not a trace of Lady Agnes. The
truth could no longer be concealed. The alarm and excitement among the wedding
guests may easily be imagined. All the gentlemen at once put on their hats, and
with lanterns and brandy flasks proceeded to search the park in every
direction. A man was despatched post-haste on the swiftest horse for the
bridegroom. One gentleman rode with him to Barnham, woke up the police, and
instructed them to be on the alert, but, if possible, to keep matters quiet.
Especially they were to look out for the dog Dando, who was known to have
accompanied Lady Agnes, but had not returned.
</p>

<p>
Marese reached The Towers about one in the morning. During his ride he had
mastered his feelings; he had crushed down the superstitious presentiment which
warned him that all was in vain. He had not felt so unusually nervous about
this marriage for nothing. But he mastered himself. One of his maxims was never
to regret the past, but to apply the mind with iron will to make the best of
the present. He called the servants, naturally taking the lead, and made them
tell him all they knew. Then for the first time Lady Agnes’ strange
visits to “The Pot” became known; and at once the gloomiest
forebodings filled the minds of the guests. She was drowned; she had fallen
down “The Pot.” The idea grew and grew, till it became the one
belief. Marese himself could not doubt it. It was a strange and solemn conclave
they held, at that hour of the night, in the hall at The Towers, Marese
standing in the midst, his face pale but composed, the guests crowding round
him, the servants coming up one by one to be examined. The great clock at The
Towers tolled two, and there stepped silently into the room a stranger, plainly
dressed, but remarkably upright, with an air of authority—the
Superintendent of police from Barnham. A silence followed his entrance. He
marked it, and said that he had brought drags to search the river—was
there a boat anywhere to be obtained?
</p>

<p>
There was no boat. The Ise ran so swift and was so shallow at ordinary times,
and lay so deep down between its banks, that no one cared to keep a boat. The
nearest known was a little punt four miles down the river, where it enlarged
into a small lake. A man was despatched to borrow it, and pole it up the rapid
stream; he could not reach “The Pot,” work as hard as he might,
under three hours. All the gentlemen and not a few of the ladies, too excited
to sit quietly within, went with the Superintendent across the park to
“The Pot,” and watched the drags used. The Superintendent asked
them to stand back a moment while he examined the ground round the mouth of the
funnel. He did so carefully; the grass had left no mark of a footstep, there
was not a trace of a struggle, not a scrap of dress hanging to a twig, or a
broken ornament. Then the drags were dropped down the strange funnel into the
roaring water, and under the quiet stars the wedding guests gathered in a
circle, watching the police as they searched the cave in vain. Neither drag nor
pole could detect anything at the bottom; the light of the strongest
bull’s-eye failed to show any trace that a body had fallen down that
narrow crevice; no stones or earth recently dislodged, not a particle of dress
or shawl here either.
</p>

<p>
By this time the ladies were tired, and shivered in the early morning breeze;
they retired, but the gentlemen, greatly excited, stayed and assisted to fish
the river Ise downwards for miles. The body would surely be carried with the
current: but no, not a trace. The bright sun of the glorious May morning found
them still at the mournful task. This was the wedding morning. The thrushes
burst into song; the cuckoo flew over with his merry cry; dewdrops glittered
like gems upon the bushes, and the lovely May bloom scented the breeze. A
wedding morn indeed!—but where was the bride? More than one glanced for a
moment from the turbid river up to the deep azure of the sky, and the natural
thought that followed need not be described. They met the punt at
last—but it was useless. The man who poled it up had kept a close look
out; nothing had floated by.
</p>

<p>
“We shall not find it,” said the Superintendent, “till the
flood subsides.”
</p>

<p>
Even yet there was one hope as they walked sadly back to The Towers: the dog
Dando—where was he? It was reasonable to think that if Lady Lechester had
fallen into the river, the dog would presently return to The Towers. If he did
not return, there was still hope that she had wandered in some other direction,
or had met with an accident—sprained her ankle, or broken her leg in the
woods, perhaps. This idea had occurred to the Superintendent and to Marese long
before, and the gamekeeper, with eight or ten willing assistants, had been
searching the woods for hours. As they neared The Towers it was obvious from
the group of people talking excitedly before the entrance that something had
happened. A policeman came towards them, leading Dando in a leash.
</p>

<p>
He had but just arrived in a trap from Barnham town. Questions poured out from
a hundred lips; it was difficult to get an explanation, but it was understood
at last. The Superintendent on leaving Barnham had not omitted to warn the men
on their heats in the town to look out for a dog—Lady Lechester’s
well-known dog—merely as a forlorn hope, never dreaming that Dando would
wander thither. But a little after sunrise, perhaps about six o’clock,
the dog Dando walked up the high street of Barnham behind a man wearing a grey
suit, who knocked at the door of Mr Broughton’s private residence. Before
the knock was answered the man in the grey suit was in custody, and the dog
secured. The man in the grey suit struggled violently—fought like a wild
beast, which still further prejudiced the police against him, and was with
difficulty handcuffed, manacled, and conveyed to the station-house on a
stretcher. No one to look at his slight figure would have thought him capable
of such savage battling. He asked perpetually for Mr Broughton, declared that
he was not mad—which was strange, as no one had accused him of that
failing, and refused to give his name—another trait that looked ill. When
asked if he had seen Lady Lechester he denied all knowledge of such a person.
The dog had followed him just as any other dog might. As to the road he had
come he was obstinately silent. The police had not waited to waste further
inquiries upon him, but hastened to The Towers with the news for their chief.
</p>

<p>
His face fell immediately. “I fear,” he said, “that Lady
Lechester is indeed lost. The dog would never have left her unless. However, we
have now got a clue.”
</p>

<p>
Marese gave up all hope; yet with his old cool self-possession before he
started with the Superintendent for Barnham, he wrote out a telegram and
despatched it to Theodore, briefly acquainting him with what had happened, and
asking him to be especially agreeable <i>to that person</i>—meaning
Violet, whose value as a second string to the bow had risen at once. This
telegram was despatched to a dead man: Theodore had been killed the night
before in the Sternhold Hall, but in the confusion and the difficulty of at
once identifying bodies, no news had been sent to Marese.
</p>

<p>
With the Superintendent, Marese went into the cell at the police station, and
saw Aymer Malet handcuffed and manacled. Poor Aymer, indeed! His hair was rough
over his forehead, his cheeks stained with blood from a scratch received in the
struggle, his whole look wild in the extreme. He saw Marese Baskette, the
murderer, the man who had confined him. Is it to be wondered at that he grew
excited? He said nothing, but his face worked, and his teeth ground together.
Marese looked at him steadily, almost with a smile. In that moment, swift as it
passed, he debated upon his best course. Truth, or what he called truth, was
the safest, although it would save Aymer’s life.
</p>

<p>
“I know this man,” he said. “He is a lunatic; he has escaped
from my cousin’s asylum at Stirmingham. He is very dangerous: without a
doubt, this is the guilty party.”
</p>

<p>
Aymer denied it. All his efforts were to make people believe that he was not
mad. As yet he had no conception of the darker shadow hanging over him: his one
idea was, that he had been pursued and captured—that he should be sent
back to the asylum. Therefore he had refused to give his name, or to describe
the road by which he had come to Barnham. This very mistake increased the
suspicion against him of a knowledge of Lady Lechester’s disappearance.
It will now be understood why Fulk burnt the paper that Violet might not read
it, and why The Place was dark and cheerless when they reached it. These events
had happened just before they arrived.
</p>

<p>
Marese never lost his presence of mind for a moment, not even when he heard of
Theodore’s awful death. Turn the mind to the present, was his maxim: do
the best with it you can. His one concern was the disappearance of Violet:
still he felt certain that he should be able to trace her. At present, the one
thing needful was to crush Aymer Malet. He held that enemy now in the hollow of
his hand: he should “taste his finger,” as the Orientals say.
</p>

<p>
The magistrates on hearing the evidence at once made out a warrant, and Aymer
was remanded, while the search went on for the body, which still eluded all
search. Upon the third day, however, some important evidence turned up, and it
was thought best to take it in the presence of the prisoner. Aymer was in
consequence led into the large apartment used for such purposes at the police
station, still wearing the handcuffs, for Marese had industriously spread the
belief that he was a dangerous lunatic. The general public were not admitted;
but a few gentlemen were present, and among these was Mr Broughton, who at once
recognised Aymer, rough as his present appearance wan, and came forward and
spoke to him. Aymer asked him to defend him, and Broughton, to his credit, said
he would. To his credit, for his interest in the Lechester estates was large.
</p>

<p>
The magistrates seeing so respectable a solicitor as Mr Broughton taking an
interest in the prisoner, consulted, and to Marese’s intense disgust
offered to allow the prisoner half an hour to confer with his attorney. In that
brief period poor Aymer had to relate his confinement and his escape. Broughton
listened attentively; then he said—
</p>

<p>
“Your story is strange, almost incredible; still you are in a position
where nothing will do you much good but public opinion. My usual advice would
be to reserve your defence; my present advice to you is to tell the Bench
exactly what you have told me, only much more fully. There are no reporters
admitted; but I will see that your statement is published. I believe you
myself. If the public show any signs of believing you, the prosecutors will
withdraw. It is your only chance; for, to be candid, the evidence is terribly
against you.”
</p>

<p>
They returned to the justice-room. The first witness called was the policeman
who had detected Aymer and the dog in the street. He described Aymer as walking
very fast, and dodging from house to house as if trying to escape notice. This
was point Number 1 against him. Then came the evidence as to his furious
struggle with the police. One constable could barely make himself understood; a
blow straight from the shoulder had knocked a tooth out, and his voice sounded
hollow and indistinct. Such a violent resistance obviously indicated a guilty
conscience. This was point Number 2 against him. Next it was stated, and stated
with perfect truth, that the prisoner had refused to give his name, his place
of residence, or any information about himself; and that, finally, he had
totally denied even so much as knowing that there was such a person as Lady
Lechester. He had tried to conceal his identity in every way, and had
deliberately told an untruth, for after living so long at World’s End,
how could he have failed to know Lady Lechester? This was point Number 3. Then
he gave a very vague, unsatisfactory account of how the dog had followed him.
He declared that the dog was a strange dog to him—that he had never seen
it before. Now this must be also a wilful falsehood. Point Number 4. But the
darkest evidence of all was reserved to the last. There was brought into the
room an “iron-witted” ploughboy, with a shock head of light hair,
small eyes, heavy jowl, and low forehead—the very class of witness most
to be dreaded, for nothing on earth can make them understand that it is
possible for them to be mistaken.
</p>

<p>
The ploughboy, Andrew Hornblow by name, told his story straightforwardly
enough. He said that he had been to the “Shepherd’s Bush”
that fateful evening, after work; that he had a pint and a half of ale, but was
not any the worse for liquor. That at about half-past seven, or a little
earlier, he left the “Shepherd’s Bush” inn to return to the
farmhouse where he slept. He went across the fields and Downs, and his path led
him over a section of the park. As he passed a fir copse he heard some one
playing on a tin whistle in a most peculiar way. He was curious: to see who it
was, and got into the copse. The moment his footsteps were heard the whistle
stopped; but pushing aside the boughs, he caught a glimpse of a tallish man, in
a grey suit—a dirty-grey suit—who seemed anxious to avoid
observation, and plunged into the dark recesses of the copse. He didn’t
think much of it at the time; but it so happened that the spot where he had
seen the man was within a hundred yards of “The Pot;” and talking
of the disappearance of Lady Lechester to his master, the fact had got to the
knowledge of the police. Had he seen that man since? Not till he had come into
the room; and he pointed at the prisoner, who indeed wore a grey suit, somewhat
travel-stained and frayed in places, as if from passage through hedges or
woods.
</p>

<p>
Mr Broughton cross-examined this witness at great length, and with his
accustomed shrewdness—but in vain, the ploughboy was certain the prisoner
was the man. All that could be got from him was, that he had not distinctly
seen the face of the man in the copse, but he was tallish, and wore a
dirty-grey suit. This established the fact that the prisoner was near about the
spot, where Lady Lechester had disappeared somewhere within half an hour of
that mysterious event.
</p>

<p>
Point Number 6 was still more convincing. Upon the prisoner being searched,
there was found upon him a tin whistle. The whistle was produced, and was of a
peculiar construction: when blown, it gave a singular sound, more musical than
the ordinary whistle. It was covered with sketches—apparently engraved
with a sharp tool—of dogs, some of them very spirited and faithful
outline representations. It was well known that the prisoner was a good
draughtsman. The only point that remained to be established was the death of
Lady Lechester. The body had not been found.
</p>

<p>
Upon this evidence the police very properly asked for a remand till the body
was discovered.
</p>

<p>
Mr Broughton immediately applied for bail.
</p>

<p>
The Bench asked upon what grounds, and this gave Aymer an opportunity to tell
his tale. Remember, that all this time Marese Baskette was sitting side by side
with the magistrates, who naturally felt for his position, and treated him with
exceptional courtesy.
</p>

<p>
When Aymer began, Marese objected on the ground that the prisoner was a lunatic
escaped from Stirmingham Asylum, and that these wild statements, if they got
into print, would do him harm. The Bench assured him that nothing the
prisoner—whose wild appearance proved the condition of his
mind—could say would prejudice him in their estimation, and as there were
no reporters present nothing could get abroad. It was better to let the
prisoner tell his tale; he might inadvertently disclose the fate of poor Lady
Lechester. It was true that the prisoner being a lunatic would escape the
extreme penalty of the law, but it was very desirable to learn all that could
be known of poor Lady Agnes. Marese had to be satisfied, and to listen while
Aymer, in clear, forcible language, told his story, hinting broadly at
Marese’s complicity in the death of Jason Waldron, and describing the
manner in which he had been trapped, and his escape. The Bench listened with an
incredulous air, as well they might. The man was evidently mad—quite mad.
Finally, Aymer came to his arrival at Belthrop late in the afternoon of the day
after he had got out of the asylum. Finding Violet was not at Hannah
Bond’s, and greatly alarmed, he was at a loss what to do. To go back to
Stirmingham was extremely dangerous for fear of re-capture, and he hesitated
for a while. At last, after partaking of refreshment given to him by old
Hannah, he had started for Barnham with the intention of calling on Mr
Broughton and taking his advice. Halfway to Barnham it had occurred to him that
perhaps Violet after all was at The Towers, and he diverged from his course and
approached the mansion, as he supposed, about one in the morning. He saw a
number of people about and in commotion, and afraid of being recognised and
captured altered his mind again, and turned to go to Barnham across the Downs.
In doing so he admitted that he had passed near “The Pot,” but not
at the time stated by the ploughboy—half-past seven in the
evening—but half-past one in the morning. As he walked through the grass
he saw something glistening, and picked up the tin whistle found upon him. He
should not have taken the trouble to carry it away had it not been for the
curious figures on it, which, being a light night, he could just distinguish.
As he came up the side of the Downs, just as he passed The Giant’s
Ring—i.e., a circle of stones set on edge—some ancient
monument—he was overtaken by the dog Dando, who jumped and fawned upon
him with delight as an old friend, and followed him to Barnham where he was
captured by the police. He had resisted them because he thought they were under
orders to return him to the asylum. The dog Dando limped a little, and he had
noticed that his back showed signs of a severe recent beating. Hannah Bond
could prove that he did not leave Belthrop till nearly or quite eight, and it
was impossible for him to get to “The Pot,” ten miles, in less than
three hours, across a rough country. His dress was dirty and torn because he
had walked quite twenty miles when arrested, and passed through several
coppices. Upon this Mr Broughton asked for bail, and offered himself in any sum
they might name. But the Bench could not get over the fact of the
asylum—the prisoner was a dangerous lunatic; even if his story was true
he was a lunatic. No; the prisoner was removed to his cell pending the
discovery of the body of Lady Lechester. All that Broughton could do was to
order his carriage and set out for Belthrop to find Hannah Bond.
</p>

<p>
Poor Aymer. It was Violet he thought of still. But events press so quickly, it
is impossible to pause and analyse his emotion. The next day about noon, Mr
Broughton came into the cell with a grave look upon his face, and carrying a
large parcel in his hand. Aymer begged him to tell him the truth at once. Mr
Broughton told him that first the body of Lady Lechester had been found. A more
careful search by boat near “The Pot” had discovered it. Instead of
being carried down by the current, an eddy at the cave had thrown it up against
the course of the stream a few yards, and lodged it behind a boulder. There
were no marks of violence: she had simply been drowned. Secondly, he had been
to Belthrop, and found Hannah Bond’s cottage shut up, the old lady gone,
and not a trace of her to be found, though he had searched the villages for
miles round. Thirdly, the book parcel in his hand had been to London to
Aymer’s address there, and had been returned to him, Aymer having left
instructions that his letters should be sent to Mr Broughton. Upon removing the
outer wrapper, there was the name and address of Aymer Malet, Esq, written in
the handwriting of the dead Lady Lechester.

<h3>Fourteen.</h3>

<p>
Fulk had a difficult game to play. In the first place, his motions were
restricted by the dread of Marese’s emissaries: he could only go out at
night. He wished to preserve Violet from a knowledge of Aymer’s
misfortune, and yet to go to work himself to release his friend. The first
thing to do was to get Hannah Bond to The Place, for clearly Violet could not
remain there alone with him. Knowing the country well, he had no difficulty on
the night after their arrival—the very night after the preliminary
examination of Aymer Malet—in finding his way to Belthrop. He explained
the circumstances to Hannah, who at once packed up a few things, and walked
back with him over the Downs to The Place, without awakening one of her
neighbours. This was how Hannah Bond disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Fulk’s knowledge of the circumstances under which Aymer had been arrested
was very meagre, but on the third day the <i>Barnham Chronicle</i> came out,
and Hannah got him a copy. In it was a full, almost verbatim, account of the
preliminary examination, furnished, in fact, by Mr Broughton. Over this paper
Fulk spent the greater part of the night thinking. He shut himself up in a room
at The Place on the pretence that he had letters to write, and studied the
report, line for line and word for word. After an hour or two, his eye became
irresistibly attracted by a little paragraph in small type, evidently added at
the last moment before going to press. It was but a few lines, announcing that
the dog Dando had again disappeared from The Towers. He had been chained up
carefully as was supposed, but he had gone in the night. This little paragraph
fixed Fulk’s attention. He tried to follow the dog’s motions. Why,
when Lady Lechester fell down “The Pot,” did not the dog return to
The Towers? Why did he turn up at The Giant’s Ring, with a limp in one
leg, as if from a kick, and his back bearing marks of a severe beating? How
came that odd and peculiar whistle in the grass—how came there to be two
men in grey, one at half-past seven, the other at half-past one? The ploughboy
had heard a peculiar whistling. By degrees the conviction forced itself into
his mind that the other than in grey—the half-past seven man—must
have been no other than his cousin Odo. All the facts answered to such a
theory. A tallish man, playing upon a tin whistle; the dog—the dog was of
the very breed that Odo had such a fancy for. The beating—doubtless the
dog had been attracted by Odo, but had refused to obey him, and had been kicked
and thrashed till he ran off, and crossed Aymer’s path. The Giant’s
Ring had actually been one of Odo’s favourite haunts before he was
confined. It was a wild and desolate spot. Fulk saw it all now clearly.
Obviously Odo was still lingering about, perhaps trying to find the whistle he
had dropped—obviously Odo had stolen the dog Dando from the The Towers a
second time. If he could find Dando, he could find Odo; and Odo found, then
Aymer’s release was a matter of time only. Fulk meditated, and at last
resolved upon his course—he would visit the haunts which he knew Odo used
to favour. But Odo was a strong and powerful man, endowed with singular
physical strength, Fulk was little, and by no means strong. Art must conquer
Nature. Fulk prepared a cord with a noose, the use of which he had learnt years
and years before in a trip to South America. It was a lasso, in fact.
</p>

<p>
Then followed an anxious time. Violet grew more and more restless. Although The
Place was so retired, yet people began to know that it was again inhabited.
Fulk had heard of strangers being seen about, and he at once guessed that
Marese had his spies searching for Aymer Malet’s companion in the escape.
Every night he went out upon his strange errand, hunting the wild man of the
woods. Meantime, an inquest was held upon poor Lady Lechester, and a verdict of
murder returned against Aymer Malet. Days and nights passed, and hunt and
search how he would, still Odo eluded him.
</p>

<p>
It was a warm, beautiful evening. The same lucent planet that had so often
shone upon Lady Lechester during her visit to the fatal “Pot,”
glittered in the western sky: but its beams were somewhat dimmed by the new
moon, whose crescent was on the point of disappearing below the horizon. Fulk,
pushing slowly and sadly through the woods and copses, inhaled the fragrance of
the pine tree. The rabbits scattered at his approach; now and then a wood
pigeon rose into the air, with a tremendous clatter. In the open it was still
light; under the trees a dusky shadow brooded. At a distance, he could faintly
hear the sound of rushing water, and the fidgety chirping of the restless
brook-sparrows and sedge-warblers. Suddenly there rose a shrill, piping sound;
and Fulk started, and his heart for a moment stood still. He listened; then
came a strange weird music—if music it could be called—for in its
indescribable cadences it reminded him of the playing of the savages in far-off
shores, visited years ago. But he recognised it in an instant. He had heard Odo
play similar notes when they were boys. Gently, gently, he crept through the
brushwood, and holding a branch aside, looked down from the bank upon the
stream. It rushed along swiftly with a murmuring sound, reflecting upon its
surface the image of the bright planet. The sedges and reeds rustled in the
light breeze; and there was Odo. Across the stream there was a fallen
tree—the very tree Odo had loved in his youth—and astride upon that
tree sat the Beast-Man, his feet nearly touching the water, playing upon a tin
whistle. Before him was the dog Dando, standing on his hind legs, and moving in
grotesque time to the music. Odo reproached the dog, and told him that he was
an unworthy son of his father, and could not dance half so well—had he
already forgotten his beating? But perhaps it was the fault of his whistle. Ah,
he had lost his best whistle—the one he had made with selected tin, and
ornamented with pictures of his dogs—among them Dando’s father, who
danced so much better. Then he muttered incoherent, half-articulate sounds to
the dog, sighed deeply, and began to play again. Poor Odo!
</p>

<p>
Fulk hesitated. There was a large soul in his little body—he pitied the
poor fellow before him from the bottom of his heart. All that singular being
wanted was the open air, and freedom to play his tin whistle, fondle his dogs,
roam in the woods, and tinker up pots and kettles. Had he been permitted to
follow these inclinations, it was doubtful if he would ever have committed
crime; but civilisation would not permit it. For a whole year he had been
roaming from wood to wood, from wilderness to wilderness, whistling, tinkering
sometimes, always happy in simple freedom. Probably he had destroyed Lady Agnes
to obtain the dog, the progenitor of which appeared to have been a favourite in
old times. But Fulk reflected that, while he hesitated, Aymer languished in the
cell, Violet was wearing her heart out, and his own liberty was endangered.
Moreover, there was a duty to society: such beings must not go wholly at large,
or no one would be safe.
</p>

<p>
The lasso hissed through the air, the noose dropped round Odo’s neck, and
was drawn tight in an instant. It had taken his neck and one shoulder. He
roared aloud with pain and anger, but the cord choked him. His arms struck out,
but he had nothing to grasp. He was dragged on shore in a moment. He
floundered—leapt up, and fell again, tearing at the rope like a wild
beast taken in the toils. With a swift, dexterous turn of the hand, Fulk wound
the cord about his arms and legs, much as a spider might its web about a fly,
till Odo lay panting on the sward, helpless, but still hoarsely murmuring and
grunting. Then Fulk loosened the lasso round his neck, and proceeded to tie the
limbs tighten, finally binding him hard and fast to a tree. Odo’s frame
quivered; and Fulk, in the dim light, fancied that great tears gathered in his
eyes. After binding Odo, there was still a piece of the rope left: with this
Fulk secured the dog, which, frightened and astonished, had cowered on the
earth. Dando evidently had no affection for Odo: he had been wiled away by
gipsy arts only. Then, leading Dando, Fulk set off at a run, tearing through
wood and hedge, mounting the steep Downs, fast as his strength could carry him,
away for Barnham town.
</p>

<p>
At that very time, late into the night, Mr Broughton was conferring with the
prisoner in his cell. He had been sent for in haste, and went quickly fearing
lest Aymer should be ill. The parcel addressed to Aymer Malet in Lady
Lechester’s handwriting was a large antique Bible, which Aymer recognised
in a moment as having belonged to old Jenkins, the gardener at The Place. He
had seen it lying about, but had taken no notice of it. It was in fact the very
Bible Lady Agnes had purchased of the gardener’s wife when left in
destitution by her husband’s imprisonment. Inside the Bible was a short
formal note, dated the very day in the evening of which Lady Agnes was drowned,
stating that the writer when she bought the book was unaware to whom it had
belonged, and therefore returned it to Aymer’s address—not knowing
Violet’s—as she desired to retain nothing of theirs. She added that
she would return the dog Dando if they would receive it, and tell her where to
send it. Aymer, having no occupation in his cell but melancholy thoughts and
anxious cares about Violet, naturally turned over the leaves of the noble old
book, and looking at it closer than before he found at the end, upon one of the
spare leaves, a curious inscription which purported to be a copy from a tomb.
It was in Latin, English, and Greek—a strange, fantastic
mixture—and when translated, read to the effect that Arthur Sibbold
Waldron, whilom of Wolf’s Glow, born Sibbold, afterwards Sibbold Waldron,
was married at Saint S— Church, Middlesex, and was buried at Penge in
Kent—with dates, and the usual sentiments. The entry in the Bible simply
added: “Copy of ye inscription, now defaced. Mem. To have the same
re-cut. B.W.” Here was the clue Aymer had searched for in vain, thrown
into his hands, by the operation of those strange and mysterious circumstances
over which no one has any control. He sent for Mr Broughton; and so it was that
when Fulk found that gentleman it was in the cell. The surprise of Aymer, and
his pleasure at seeing Fulk, his still greater joy and relief when Fulk in his
first sentence announced that Violet was safe, can easily be imagined. Mr
Broughton had no sooner heard Fulk’s explanation than he at once
comprehended the importance of securing Odo. He and Fulk with two assistants
drove as near the wood as practicable, and after much trouble safely lodged the
unfortunate lunatic in the hands of the police. Fulk remained with Broughton,
who very considerately went in his carriage in the morning over to The Place,
and brought Violet and Hannah Bond to his own private residence in Barnham.
</p>

<p>
At the inquiry that followed, the first step was the release of Aymer on bail,
on the testimony of Hannah Bond, that he had not left the cottage at Belthrop
till eight o’clock. The ploughboy, when shown Odo, at once declared that
this was the man he had seen—“A’ had such mortal big
ears—a’ minded that, now.” And Marese? His position became
extremely awkward. It was easy to declare that Aymer was a lunatic; but when
Fulk was produced—when the clever escape was related in exactly the same
manner by both—when Fulk added what he had overheard about the murder of
Jason Waldron, Marese could not but notice that the magistrates and the Court
looked coldly upon him. He claimed them both as escaped lunatics. Said the
Bench—
</p>

<p>
“We don’t see what right you have to them. The owner of the asylum
is dead. We will take it upon ourselves to say, that the lunatics, for
lunatics, have a remarkably sane way of talking.”
</p>

<p>
The result was, that Marese withdrew; the more he meddled with the matter, the
worse it became for him. To add to the evil complexion of affairs, Odo
confessed in his cell to the murder of Jason Waldron. He strenuously denied
having touched Lady Agnes; he declared that his sole object was the dog. The
dog was the descendant of an old favourite, and he had once followed Miss
Merton to Torquay to get it. But as he stole round from behind the oak trunk to
seize the dog, Lady Agnes saw him, started, missed her footing, and fell down
“The Pot.” He knew her—she was his cousin, and he had no
feeling against her. In all probability this story was true, as no marks of
violence were found on the body. But he frankly confessed hitting Jason Waldron
on the head with the bill-hook; and stated exactly what Fulk had already
said—that he was told by Theodore Marese, if he killed that man, <i>and
his daughter</i> (Aymer shuddered), he should be always free. He had laid in
wait for the daughter; but she was out of his reach at The Towers.
</p>

<p>
Odo concluded with a cunning wink, and called Mr Broughton to come near. He
whispered to him that he should be the richest man in the world if he would
give him liberty. Broughton humoured the miserable creature, and told the rest
to leave the cell.
</p>

<p>
Then Odo disclosed his bribe. He said that years ago the gipsies with whom he
consorted had shown him a deed, to which they attached a species of
superstitious reverence, and asked him to read it, it being in law characters,
and in Latin. It was a deed conferring an entail upon the estate at Wolfs
Glow—“the very estate,” whispered Odo, “that all the
people are trying for.”
</p>

<p>
Odo ascertained that this deed had been stolen by Romy Baskette’s elder
brother—the man who, with his mother, left the Swamp when old Will
Baskette was shot—stolen with the intention of injuring the Sibbolds, his
father’s murderers. He had watched old Sibbold poring over this deed,
therefore thought it valuable, seized his opportunity, and stole it. With the
strangest, maddest mixture of shrewdness and lunacy, Odo in his turn stole the
deed from the gipsies who had preserved it, and held it, to be used as a bribe
in case he should be captured. He now offered it to Broughton, if Broughton
would only let him go free.
</p>

<p>
The lawyer must be forgiven if he told a falsehood, and promised. Odo told him
where the deed was hidden; and, as he had described, so they found it. In that
tree which had fallen across the stream where he had used to sit astride and
whistle, halfway across was a knot. This knot with his tools he had cut
out—excavated a cavity, and used the knot to hide it; so that the closest
inspection must have failed to find it. They found the tree and the knot. They
got the knot out; there was a small tin box—Odo’s own
workmanship—and in the box was the long-lost deed.
</p>

<p>
Poor Odo of course never got his freedom; but there were friends who saw that
he was as well cared for as under the circumstances was possible. Who could
harbour revenge against such a creature? He was but the instrument in the hands
of others, and not truly guilty of poor Jason’s death. That lay at the
door of Marese and Theodore. Theodore was dead. Morally speaking, Fulk slew
Marese. He wrote a full account of what he had overheard, and it was published
in a great London paper. The asylum was searched, and the holes in the wall
found as described. By this letter Fulk secured two objects: first his own
liberty in future—for popular opinion rose with irresistible violence in
his favour; secondly, he destroyed Marese. Yet it was not the murder of Jason
Waldron which did it; it was the <i>Lucca</i>. There were people who had lost
heavily over the <i>Lucca</i>, these people pursued Marese Baskette, threatened
him with criminal, civil, and every kind of proceedings. He fled, escaping
arrest by a few hours only, taking with him five thousand pounds in gold. He is
believed to have reached California, but has not been heard of since. Whether
the Nemesis of these modern days—“circumstances over which we have
no control”—engulfed him in still deadlier ruin, was never known.
His fall, as it was, was great indeed.
</p>

<p>
By the death of Lady Agnes Lechester, Fulk succeeded to her estates, which,
added to those already his, made him one of the largest landholders in the
county. If he survives Odo, he will be a still more wealthy man. He never left
Aymer’s side till all was well.
</p>

<p>
Aymer and Violet were married in the autumn—married in the quietest
manner, and, aided pecuniarily by Fulk, left for the south of France, there to
try and efface the memory of the awful event that had embittered the path of
their love. Fulk joined them with a yacht two months later on. They are very,
very happy, but it is in a subdued and quiet manner. It is hardly possible for
them yet, even in the sunny south, to feel so abundantly joyous as would be
natural to their youth. But as the time rolls on they will gradually supplant
the old unhappy memories with fresh and pleasant pictures.
</p>

<p>
The last letter from Fulk announced that the sea breezes and the fresh air had
begun to work wonders with his complexion, and that he hoped ere long to throw
off the horrid yellow produced by his confinement, and resume his proper
colour. That was natural in Fulk; the proverb says that little men are often
conceited. Yellow or rosy, or brown, he will always be the dearest friend of
Aymer and Violet.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
And the great estate—the city of Stirmingham? To this very hour that
Gordian knot remains untied; to this very hour claimants every now and then
startle the world with extraordinary statements; and the companies having
nothing else to do, have fallen to loggerheads between themselves, and spend
their vast incomes in litigation. But aided by Fulk’s money, and the
influence his family connections possessed, Violet did at last receive a
portion of her rights; the chain of evidence proving her descent from Arthur
Sibbold was completed down to the smallest link.
</p>

<p>
The Corporation of Stirmingham, after much law and talk, were finally compelled
to acknowledge her claim. By arbitration it was settled that they were to pay
her eight thousand pounds per annum for ten years, and at the expiration of
that period, ten thousand pounds per annum to herself and heirs, in perpetual
ground rent. The companies still hold out, but it is only as to the amount they
shall contribute in the same way; and they will have to come to terms. Violet
will thus receive a large income without compromising her rights, which are
specially reserved. She has not forgotten poor Jenkins, whose Bible gave the
clue to the register of Arthur Sibbold’s marriage. The old man is at last
recompensed for his long-suffering—the imprisonment expired in due time.
He and his wife live in the old cottage at The Place, tending the gardens as of
yore, being made comfortable with an ample provision from Violet.
</p>

<p>
Violet and Aymer once a year visit The Place and the tomb of poor Jason. They
have taken a mansion at Tunbridge Wells, but spend much time in Aymer’s
beloved Florence, with Fulk. They love the old house, and yet they do not care
to live where everything recalls such gloomy memories as at The Place.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The End.
